# Exchange Balance

The Stablecoin Exchange allows you to hold token balances directly on the DEX contract. This eliminates the need for token transfers on every trade, significantly reducing gas costs for active traders and liquidity providers.

## Checking Your Balance

View your balance of any token held on the DEX:

```solidity
function balanceOf(
    address user,
    address token
) external view returns (uint128)
```

**Example:**
```solidity
uint128 balance = exchange.balanceOf(msg.sender, USDC_ADDRESS);
```

## Depositing to the DEX

There is no deposit function. When you execute a swap or place an order, the exchange automatically:

1. Checks if you have sufficient balance in the DEX
2. If insufficient, transfers the needed amount from your wallet to your DEX balance
3. Uses your DEX balance for the operation

## Withdrawing from the DEX

Transfer tokens from your DEX balance back to your wallet:

```solidity
function withdraw(
    address token,
    uint128 amount
) external
```

**Parameters:**
- `token` - The token address to withdraw
- `amount` - The amount to withdraw

**Example:**
```solidity
// Withdraw 1000 USDC from exchange to your wallet
exchange.withdraw(USDC_ADDRESS, 1000e6);
```

<Callout type="warning">
  The withdraw function will revert if you attempt to withdraw more than your available balance on the exchange.
</Callout>

## How Balances Work

### When Swapping

- **Before swap**: Exchange checks your balance, transfers from wallet if needed
- **After swap**: Output tokens are transferred directly to your wallet (not kept on exchange)

### When Placing Orders

- **On placement**: Required tokens are debited from your exchange balance (or transferred from wallet if insufficient)
- **When filled**: Proceeds are credited to your exchange balance
- **On cancellation**: Unfilled portion is refunded to your exchange balance
