# Transaction Fees

Tempo has no native token. Instead, transaction fees—including both gas fees and priority fees—can be paid directly in stablecoins. When you send a transaction, you can choose which supported stablecoin to use for fees.

For a stablecoin to be accepted, it must be USD-denominated, issued as a native TIP-20 contract, and have sufficient liquidity on the native Fee AMM.

Tempo uses a fixed base fee (rather than a variable base fee as in EIP-1559), set so that a TIP-20 transfer costs less than $0.001. All fees accrue to the validator who proposes the block.
