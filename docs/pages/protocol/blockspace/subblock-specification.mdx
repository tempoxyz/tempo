# Subblock Specification

## Abstract

This proposal allows non-proposing validators to propose a limited set of transactions in each block through signed **subblocks**. Subblocks are sent directly to the main proposer and their transactions are included in the block as described below. Consensus does not enforce inclusion. The proposer is incentivized to include subblocks by provisioning additional gas upon subblock inclusion, which permits them to include additional transactions at the bottom of the block as described below. 

## Motivation

In traditional blockchains, only the current block proposer can include transactions. This means validators must wait for their scheduled slot to provide fast inclusion for their users. Tempo changes this by letting **all validators** contribute transactions to every block through subblocks.

For validators, this is good as they no longer have to wait for their turn as proposer to provide low-latency inclusion for their users. They have guaranteed access to blockspace in every block, allowing them to include transactions whenever needed. Validators can also ensure a specific transaction execution order within their subblock, giving them controlled ordering of their transactions.

For users, this is good because transactions can be included faster since they can go through any validator, not just the current proposer. Access to blockspace becomes more predictable as it is smoothed across all validators rather than being concentrated with a single proposer. Time-sensitive transactions benefit from lower latency and can be included more quickly.

This proposal smooths access to blockspace across validators. It enables every validator to provide low-latency inclusion for themselves, their users, or their partners, without waiting for their turn as proposer.

## Specification

This specification describes the process in temporal order. 

### 0. Definitions

  * The gas limit of the whole block is `G`. There are `n` validators: 1 proposer and `n-1` other non-proposers. 
  * `f` fraction of the gas limit of the  block, `0 < f < 1` is reserved for the main proposer.

### 1. Subblocks

  * Each validator can construct a subblock. Subblocks follow this structure:
```
subblock = rlp([version, parent_hash, fee_recipient, [transactions], signature])
```
where:
* `version = 1`,
* `parent_hash` is the parent hash of the previous block.  
* `fee_recipient` is the EOA at which this validator wants to receive the fees included in this block. 
* `[transactions]` is an ordered list of transactions. Transactions in a subblock must satisfy additional conditions described below in [Section 1.1](#11-subblock-transactions). We explicitly allow for this list to be empty: a validator with no transactions to propose may still send a subblock so that the proposer gets extra gas for the gas incentive region, described below. 
*  The `signature` field is the validator signing over a hash computed as
`keccak256(magic_byte || rlp([version, parent_hash, fee_recipient, [transactions]]))`,
where `magic_byte = 0x78`,  The signature ensures that this subblock is valid only for the declared slot, and that the proposer cannot alter the order or set of transactions included in a subblock.
* The validator sends this subblock directly to the next proposer. 


For each validator `i`, define 
   
   `unreservedGas[i] = (1 - f) * G / n - Σ(gasLimit of transactions in subblock[i])`

#### 1.1 Subblock Transactions

We use the two-dimensional nonce sequence to simplify transaction validity. In this construction, the nonce_key is a `u256` value. 

Let `validatorPubKey` be the public key of the validator proposing a given subblock. Let `validatorPubKey120` be the most significant 120 bits of the validator's public key. 

We reserve sequence keys to each validator by requiring that the first (most significant) byte of the `sequence key` is the constant byte `0x5b`, and the next 15 bytes (120 bits) encode `validatorPubKey120`.

Formally, we require that:

1. The `sequence key` of any transaction in the subblock is of the form `(0x5b << 248) + (validatorPubKey120 << 128) + x`, where `x` is a value between `0` and `2**128 - 1`. In other words, the most significant byte of the sequence key is always `0x5b`, the next 15 bytes are the most significant 120 bits of the validator's public key, and the final 32 bytes (128 bits) still allow for 2D-nonces.

2. No two validators share the same `validatorPubKey120`; each validator's reserved space is distinct.

This explicit prefixing with `0x5b` ensures the reserved sequence key space is unambiguous and disjoint across validators. Subblock proposers control all sequence keys of the form above, and can ensure that nonces are sequential within their space.  

<Callout type="note">
**Reserved Nonce Space**

To prevent transaction conflicts, each validator has a reserved nonce space. Transactions in subblocks use special nonce sequence keys that identify which validator proposed them. This ensures that validators can't interfere with each other's transactions.
</Callout>

Further, we require that subblock transactions are signed solely by the root EOA key of the address sending the transaction.

### 2. Block Construction

The proposer collects subblocks from other validators. It now constructs a block with the following contents:

```
transactions = [list of own transactions] | [subblock transactions] | [gas incentive transactions]
```

  * `list of own transactions` are regular transactions from the proposer with `f * G` gas limit.
  * `subblock transactions` are transactions from the included subblocks. **This includes a subblock from the proposer itself if the proposer desires.** Nonce sequence keys with prefix  `0x5b` should only appear in this section.
  * `gas incentive transactions` are additional transactions that the proposer can include after the subblock transactions, with additional gas defined below.

We have the following new **header field**:
```
shared_gas_limit  // The total gas limit allocated for the subblocks and gas incentive transactions
```

#### 2.1 System transaction

The block includes a **new system transaction**, whose call data contains, for each included subblock, the public key of the validator proposing, the `feeRecipient` for that subblock and the signature of the subblock. It is a no-op, and is there for execution layer blocks to be self-contained/carry all context.

### 3. Proposer Behavior

* Construct Main Block in the usual way.
* Collect subblocks from validators, including from self. Verify signatures and gas bounds of subblocks. Skip (i.e., do not include) invalid or missing subblocks; include valid ones. Transactions from a subblock must be contiguous in the block, but subblocks can be included in any order. 
* Compute proposer Gas Incentive section limit:
  ```
  gasIncentiveLimit =  Σ(unreservedGas[i]) for all included subblocks [i]
  ```
* Append transactions at the bottom up to this gas limit. 
* Construct and include the [system transaction](#21-system-transaction) at the bottom of the block.


#### 3.1 Proposer Incentives

  * We do not enforce censorship-resistance for the transactions at consensus layer. 
  * Proposer is incentivized by additional gas from subblocks included and reciprocity. 
  * Additional gas is unrestricted so it could include backruns etc from subblock transactions. 

### 4. Block Validity Rules:
We can now define what a valid block is:
  1. Gas Limits: 
      * `[list of own transactions]` uses gas at most `f * G`. 
      * `[subblock transactions]`: the sum of `gas_limits` of all transactions in each subblock is lower than the per-subblock gas limit: `Σ(gasLimit of transactions in subblock[i]) <= (1-f) * G / n`.
      * `[gas incentive transactions]` use total gas `<= gasIncentiveLimit`.
      * General transactions gas limit from payments lane spec applies to `[list of own transactions]`. 
  2. Transactions with nonce sequence key prefix `0x5b` appear only in the `[subblock transactions]`. Transactions are contiguous by validator. 
  The `[list of own transactions]` and `[gas incentive transactions]` can use any un-reserved `sequence key`. 
  3. [System transaction](#21-system-transaction) is present, in the correct position, and valid (matches contents of the block). 
  4. Transactions in the main proposers's section and the gas incentive section are valid in the standard way (signature, nonce, can pay fees).

#### 4.1  Failures for Subblock Transactions

Even if a transaction can pay its fees when the subblock is created (i.e., when the subblock is sent to the proposer), it may not be able to pay its fees when the subblock is included and the block is processed. Here is a list of possible scenarios:

* **Fee Failure Scenarios**:
- The Fee AMM liquidity for the user's `fee_token` is insufficient (e.g., it was used up by previous transactions in the block).
- The user's balance of the `fee_token` is insufficient (e.g., the user spent that balance in previous transactions in the block).
- The user or validator changed their `fee_token` preference in the block and the transaction cannot pay its fees because of the new preference.

In all these scenarios, transaction is considered valid, increments the nonce, skips fee payment and execution, and results in an exceptional halt.

### 5. Transaction Fee Accounting

The fee manager is updated to handle fee accounting across subblocks:
- For the main proposer transactions, fees are paid to the main proposer's `fee_recipient` as usual.
- For the subblock transactions, fees are paid to the `fee_recipient` of the subblock (available from the system transaction).
- For the gas incentive transactions, fees are paid to the proposer's `fee_recipient`.

In all cases, the fee is paid in the preferred `fee_token` of the `fee_recipient`, using liquidity from the fee AMM as necessary (i.e., `validatorTokens[fee_recipient]` from the FeeManager contract). If the `fee_recipient`  has not set a preferred `fee_token`, then we use pathUSD as a fallback.
