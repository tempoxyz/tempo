# TIP Title
This document defines a template for Tempo Improvement Proposals (TIPs) on Tempo.

Each TIP fully describes a change to the Tempo protocol. TIPs are assigned incremental numbers, starting with 1000.

The goal is to define a specification that is clear, descriptive, and acts as the single source of truth for the implementation, inform the test suite, and the eventual node implementation.

# Overview

## Abstract
Short 2–4 sentence high level summary

## Motivation

Explain what problem this solves/functionality this introduces, and any alternatives considered (if applicable). Add context or links to other specs/resources that serve as prerequisites to this spec.

# Specification


This section should provide a complete description of the feature’s behavior and required interfaces.

If the feature introduces a precompile, this section should include the full interface definition along with comprehensive NatSpec. Each function should clearly describe its parameters, return values, and error conditions. The goal is to define the intended functionality clearly enough that an engineer can implement the reference contract, test suite, and node implementation without needing to infer any implementation details.

For features that do not introduce a precompile, this section should define the exact mechanics of the feature/system. Describe the relevant state transitions, data structures, encodings, etc. When the feature interacts with existing components, explain how they relate and how data moves between them each system component.

Where a feature involves multiple processes, state diagrams / flowcharts should be considered when helpful.

# Invariants

This section should describe invariants that must always hold, and outline the critical cases that the test suite must cover.
