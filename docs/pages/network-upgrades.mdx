## Network Upgrades

**Were you using the Tempo testnet before January 8th, 2025?**

If so, you'll need to migrate to our new testnet. On January 8th, we launched the **Moderato testnet** to replace the original Andantino testnet, which will be deprecated on **March 8th, 2025**.

### Why We Migrated

While Andantino was originally intended to remain persistent, we determined that launching a new testnet would better serve the community by:

- **Faster feature releases**: Ship improvements more quickly
- **Better mainnet alignment**: Moderato closely mirrors our mainnet release candidate
- **Improved reliability**: Updated infrastructure provides better stability

This creates some short-term migration work, but minimizes future disruptions and ensures the testnet mirrors mainnet behavior.

### Migration Steps

:::steps
#### 1. Update Chain Configuration

**Old Andantino Configuration:**

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| RPC URL | `https://testnet.tempo.xyz` |
| Chain ID | `42429` |
| Explorer | [explore.andantino.tempo.xyz](https://explore.andantino.tempo.xyz) |

**New Moderato Configuration:**

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| RPC URL | `https://rpc.moderato.tempo.xyz` |
| Chain ID | `42431` |
| Explorer | [explore.tempo.xyz](https://explore.tempo.xyz) |

See the [Connection Details](/quickstart/connection-details) page for complete configuration examples.

#### 2. Redeploy Contracts

Contracts deployed on Andantino must be redeployed on Moderato. The process is identical, just use the new RPC and chain ID.

If running a Tempo node, update to version **`v1.0.0-rc.1`**.

#### 3. Reset Databases & Indexers

Any databases, indexers, or systems depending on Andantino data must be reset. Old testnet data is not compatible with Moderato.

#### 4. External Node Providers

If you're using an external node provider, let us know. All major providers running Andantino have committed to supporting Moderato.

## Transition Period

Andantino remains available until **March 8th, 2025** but stopped receiving updates on January 8th.

If continuing to run an Andantino node during the transition:
- Add the `--chain testnet` flag
- Do not update to `v1.0.0-rc.1`
