## Connect to the Network

You can connect with the Tempo Testnet like you would with any other EVM chain.

### Connect using a Browser Wallet

Click on your browser wallet below to automatically connect it to the Tempo Testnet.

<ConnectWallet />

:::warning
Note that on some wallets, you might see an unusually high "balance". This is because, historically, blockchain wallets have always assumed that a blockchain has a "native gas token". On Tempo, there is no native gas token, and so the value shown is a placeholder. See [EVM Differences](/quickstart/evm-compatibility#handling-eth-balance-checks) for more information on this quirk.

### Connect via CLI

To connect via CLI, we recommend using [`cast`](https://getfoundry.sh/cast/overview/), which is a command-line tool for interacting with Ethereum networks. To install cast, you can read more in the [Foundry SDK docs](/sdk/foundry#get-started-with-foundry).

```bash /dev/null/monitor.sh#L1-11
# Check block height (should be steadily increasing)
cast block-number --rpc-url http://rpc.testnet.tempo.xyz
```
