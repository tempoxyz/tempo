Recommendation for wallets
Handle native token balance checks
On Tempo, there is no native gas token.

Complication
Many wallets and apps use eth_getBalance as a check before allowing users to progress in their flows

Recommendation
Remove this balance check and don’t represent any “native balance” in your user’s UI when interacting on Tempo.
Replace the native balance check and instead check the balance of the user’s fee token[0, 1]
Specifying a native token currency symbol
Complication
Many wallets display a native token symbol in flow, e.g. presenting how much gas a transaction requires.

Recommendation
Fees on Tempo are denominated in USD, so we recommend using the currency symbol “USD”.
Gas token selection
Fees can be paid in any stablecoin on Tempo.

Complication
Wallets display gas in a network’s native token today. What should they display as the gas token for transactions on Tempo?

Recommendation
We recommend integrating with Tempo Transactions to have full control over the fee_token field on the transaction being sent.

If you / the wallet is not using Tempo Transactions or is not setting fee_token on the Tempo transaction, there is a cascading fee token selection algorithm that determines the fee token used based on the user’s preference and the contract being called. 

Details here[2] and a high level overview below:
User default fee token. You can specify a default fee token at the account level and retrieve its value[0].
If the user is interacting with a TIP-20 token, the default fee token is that token itself. Example: if you call transfer on AlphaUSD, the default fee token would be AlphaUSD
Default fallback: PathUSD is the fallback
