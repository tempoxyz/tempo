## Ecosystem

Tempo is currently in development, with the mainnet launch coming in early 2026. Over the coming weeks, we're bringing online all the core infrastructure needed for stablecoin use cases like [remittances](/learn/use-cases/remittances), [global payouts](/learn/use-cases/global-payouts), [embedded finance](/learn/use-cases/embedded-finance), [tokenized deposits](/learn/use-cases/tokenized-deposits), [microtransactions](/learn/use-cases/microtransactions), and [agentic commerce](/learn/use-cases/agentic-commerce) so that they're available on Day 1 of the mainnet launch.

The Tempo ecosystem is being built with a diverse range of best-in-class partners across stablecoin issuance, wallets & custody, compliance tooling, fraud monitoring, interoperability protocols, analytics & monitoring, orchestration and ramps, and more. We're designing the ecosystem to be global from day one, with issuers across the globe and broad local currency support.

If you're interested in becoming an ecosystem partner, get in touch with us today to ensure you're fully set up for the Tempo mainnet launch coming soon.

If you're looking for local partners to work with on your stablecoin deployment and want to work with one of our ecosystem partners, visit our [ecosystem page](https://tempo.xyz/ecosystem) to see the full list or [get in touch](mailto:partners@tempo.xyz) with us to discuss how you can best integrate with Tempo.
