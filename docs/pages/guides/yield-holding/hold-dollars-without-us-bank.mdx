# How to Hold US Dollars Without a US Bank Account

For billions of people worldwide, accessing US dollars is difficult or impossible through traditional banking. Stablecoins change this—offering dollar-denominated savings to anyone with an internet connection.

## The Problem with Traditional Dollar Access

- **Geographic restrictions**: US bank accounts typically require US residency
- **High fees**: International wire transfers and currency conversion eat into savings
- **Limited access**: Many countries have capital controls or unstable local currencies
- **Slow transfers**: Cross-border payments take days and involve intermediaries

## Stablecoins: Global Dollar Access

Stablecoins like USDC and USDT are digital dollars backed 1:1 by reserves. They provide:

- **Dollar stability**: Hold value pegged to USD, protected from local currency volatility
- **No geographic limits**: Anyone with a wallet can hold and transfer stablecoins
- **Self-custody**: You control your funds with your private keys
- **Instant transfers**: Send and receive globally in seconds

## Why Tempo for Global Dollar Holdings

[Tempo](https://docs.tempo.xyz/learn/tempo) is purpose-built for stablecoin payments and holdings, making it ideal for international users:

### Pay Fees in Stablecoins

Other blockchains require holding volatile cryptocurrencies for gas fees. On Tempo, you pay transaction fees in the same stablecoins you hold—keeping your entire balance in dollars.

### Sub-Cent Fees

High fees defeat the purpose of accessible savings. Tempo's sub-cent transaction costs make it practical to:

- Receive remittances without losing value to fees
- Make small, regular savings deposits
- Transfer between wallets affordably

### Instant Settlement

Payments finalize in seconds. When you receive dollars from family abroad or need to move funds, there's no waiting.

### Payment Metadata

Attach context to every transaction—references, notes, or invoice data. This makes it easier to track remittances, payments, and savings.
