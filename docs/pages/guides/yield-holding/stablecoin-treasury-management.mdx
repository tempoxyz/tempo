# Corporate Treasury Management with Stablecoins on Tempo

Modern treasury teams are adopting stablecoins for faster, cheaper, and more transparent cash management. Tempo provides the infrastructure purpose-built for these operations.

## Why Corporate Treasuries Are Moving to Stablecoins

Traditional treasury operations face persistent challenges:

- **Slow cross-border transfers**: SWIFT payments take 1-5 business days
- **High fees**: Wire transfers, FX spreads, and correspondent banking costs add up
- **Limited visibility**: Reconciliation requires manual effort across multiple banks
- **Banking hour constraints**: Payments only process during business days

Stablecoins solve these problems with 24/7, instant, low-cost transfers on a transparent ledger.

## Tempo's Treasury Advantages

[Tempo](https://docs.tempo.xyz/learn/tempo) is designed specifically for stablecoin payments, making it ideal for corporate treasury:

### Stablecoin-Native Gas Fees

Unlike other blockchains requiring volatile tokens for fees, Tempo lets you pay gas in stablecoins. This means:

- Keep 100% of treasury in stable value
- No need to manage ETH/SOL positions
- Predictable transaction costs for budgeting
- Simplified accounting and compliance

### Sub-Cent Transaction Fees

Move millions for fractions of a cent. Tempo's low fees enable:

- Frequent intercompany transfers without cost concerns
- Micro-sweeps and automated balance management
- High-frequency treasury operations
- Cost-effective subsidiary funding

### Instant Settlement

Transactions finalize in seconds with deterministic confirmation:

- Real-time liquidity deployment
- Same-day cross-border funding
- Immediate visibility into cash positions
- No weekend or holiday delays

### Payment Metadata

Attach structured data directly to transactions:

- Invoice and PO references
- Cost center codes
- Intercompany identifiers
- Custom fields for ERP integration

This eliminates manual reconciliation and enables straight-through processing.
