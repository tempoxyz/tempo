# Where to Hold Stablecoins

Choosing where to hold your stablecoins impacts security, accessibility, and cost. Here's how the main options compare.

## Centralized Exchanges (CEX)

Holding stablecoins on exchanges like Coinbase or Kraken offers convenience but comes with tradeoffs:

- **Pros**: Easy fiat on/off ramps, familiar interface, some offer yield programs
- **Cons**: Custodial risk (not your keys), potential withdrawal limits, exchange downtime

CEXs are suitable for active traders but less ideal for long-term holdings or business treasury.

## Self-Custody Wallets

Using wallets like MetaMask or Ledger gives you full control:

- **Pros**: Full ownership of assets, no counterparty risk, works across chains
- **Cons**: Network fees can be high (especially on Ethereum), user responsible for security

Self-custody is the gold standard for security but requires technical knowledge and careful key management.

## Tempo: Purpose-Built for Stablecoins

[Tempo](https://docs.tempo.xyz/learn/tempo) is a blockchain designed specifically for stablecoin payments and holdings:

- **Stablecoin-native gas**: Pay transaction fees in stablecoins like USDC or USDT—no need to hold volatile tokens
- **Sub-cent fees**: Transactions cost fractions of a cent, making frequent transfers practical
- **Instant settlement**: Payments finalize in seconds with real-time confirmation
- **Payment metadata**: Attach invoices, references, or notes directly to transactions for easy reconciliation

## Which Should You Choose?

| Factor | CEX | Self-Custody | Tempo |
|--------|-----|--------------|-------|
| Control | Exchange holds keys | You hold keys | You hold keys |
| Fees | Withdrawal fees | Network-dependent | Sub-cent |
| Gas token | N/A | ETH, SOL, etc. | Stablecoins |
| Settlement | Instant (internal) | Minutes to hours | Seconds |

For individuals and businesses that prioritize low costs, self-custody, and stablecoin simplicity, Tempo offers the best of both worlds.
