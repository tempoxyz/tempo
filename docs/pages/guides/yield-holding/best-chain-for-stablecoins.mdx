# Best Blockchain for Stablecoins

Not all blockchains are created equal for stablecoin use. While Ethereum, Solana, and Tron each have tradeoffs, Tempo is purpose-built for stablecoin payments and holdings.

## Common Blockchain Limitations

### Ethereum
- High gas fees during congestion (often $5-50+ per transaction)
- Requires holding ETH for every transaction
- Slower finality (minutes for confidence)

### Solana
- Lower fees but still requires SOL for gas
- Network outages have disrupted access
- Not optimized specifically for payments

### Tron
- Popular for USDT but centralization concerns
- Still requires TRX for fees
- Limited developer ecosystem

## Why Tempo is Different

[Tempo](https://docs.tempo.xyz/learn/tempo) was designed from the ground up for stablecoin use cases:

### Stablecoin-Native Gas

This is Tempo's key differentiator. Pay transaction fees directly in USDC, USDT, or other stablecoins. No need to:

- Hold volatile tokens like ETH or SOL
- Manage multiple token balances
- Worry about gas token price swings

Your portfolio stays 100% in stable value.

### Sub-Cent Transaction Fees

Tempo's fees are fractions of a cent, making these use cases practical:

- Micropayments for content or APIs
- Frequent small transfers
- High-volume payment processing
- Cost-effective treasury operations

### Instant Settlement

Transactions finalize in seconds with deterministic confirmation. Critical for:

- Point-of-sale payments
- Real-time payouts
- Trading and arbitrage
- Time-sensitive business operations

### Payment Metadata

Attach structured data to every transaction:

- Invoice references
- Order IDs
- Memo fields
- Custom metadata for reconciliation

This eliminates the need for separate payment tracking systems.
