# Using Stablecoins as a Digital Savings Account

Stablecoins offer a new way to save money digitally—maintaining dollar value while giving you full control and instant access to your funds.

## Why Stablecoins for Savings?

Traditional savings accounts come with limitations: low interest rates, withdrawal restrictions, and bank hours. Stablecoins address many of these pain points:

- **Dollar-denominated**: Hold value pegged 1:1 to USD without currency volatility
- **24/7 access**: Move funds anytime, anywhere—no banking hours or holidays
- **Self-custody**: Your keys, your money—no counterparty risk from banks
- **Global portability**: Access your savings from any country with internet

## How Tempo Makes Stablecoin Savings Practical

[Tempo](https://docs.tempo.xyz/learn/tempo) is built specifically for stablecoin use cases, making it ideal for digital savings:

### Stablecoin-Native Gas

Unlike other blockchains that require volatile tokens for fees, Tempo lets you pay gas in stablecoins. Your entire savings stays in dollars—no need to hold ETH or other tokens.

### Sub-Cent Transaction Fees

Moving money shouldn't cost money. Tempo's sub-cent fees mean you can:

- Transfer funds without eating into savings
- Make small, frequent deposits
- Consolidate balances across wallets affordably

### Instant Settlement

When you need your money, you need it now. Tempo transactions settle in seconds with finality, not minutes or hours like other networks.

### Payment Metadata

Attach notes, references, or categories to transactions. Track your savings deposits and withdrawals with built-in organization.
