# Send Money to Nigeria with Crypto

Send money to Nigeria using stablecoins on Tempo. Fast, low-cost transfers to one of Africa's largest remittance markets.

## Nigeria Remittance Corridor

Nigeria receives $20+ billion in remittances annually. Traditional channels are expensive:
- Wire transfers: $30-50 + FX spreads
- Remittance services: 5-10% fees
- Delivery: 1-5 days

## Why Nigerians Embrace Crypto

Nigeria has one of the highest crypto adoption rates globally. Many recipients:
- Already have crypto wallets
- Use P2P platforms regularly
- Prefer stablecoin stability over naira volatility

## How to Send

1. **Buy USDC** on any exchange or on-ramp
2. **Send to Nigerian recipient** via Tempo (~$0.001 fee)
3. **Instant arrival** — recipient sees funds in seconds
4. **Convert to naira** via local platforms when needed

## Off-Ramp Options

Nigerian recipients have multiple conversion options:
- P2P platforms (very liquid market)
- Local exchanges
- Crypto-to-mobile-money services
- Direct spending at accepting merchants

## Advantages Over Traditional Methods

| Factor | Traditional | Tempo |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Speed | 1-5 days | <1 second |
| Cost | 5-10% | ~$0.001 |
| Access | Banking hours | 24/7 |
| FX Rate | Spread hidden | Transparent |

## Considerations

- P2P markets offer competitive NGN rates
- Recipients can hold USDC as hedge against naira volatility
- No daily limits typical of traditional services
