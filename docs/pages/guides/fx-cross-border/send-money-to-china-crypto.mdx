# Send Money to China with Crypto

Send money to China using stablecoins on Tempo. Navigate complex cross-border payment challenges with crypto rails.

## China Cross-Border Challenges

China has strict capital controls and complex banking requirements for international transfers:

- Wire transfers: $30-60 + FX spreads
- Documentation requirements: Extensive
- Transfer limits: Daily/annual caps
- Delivery: 3-7 days

## The Crypto Alternative

Despite domestic restrictions, crypto provides options:
- P2P markets operate across borders
- Hong Kong serves as a gateway
- Stablecoins offer USD stability
- 24/7 availability bypasses banking hours

## How to Send

1. **Buy USDC** on any exchange or on-ramp
2. **Send to recipient** via Tempo (~$0.001 fee)
3. **Instant arrival** — recipient sees funds in seconds
4. **Convert to CNY** via available channels

## Off-Ramp Considerations

Recipients should understand local options:
- Hong Kong-based exchanges (for HK residents)
- P2P marketplaces
- Cross-border crypto services
- Peer-to-peer networks

Note: Recipients should ensure compliance with local regulations.
