# Send Money to Bangladesh with Crypto

Send money to Bangladesh instantly using stablecoins on Tempo. Avoid the high fees that eat into family support.

## Bangladesh Remittance Corridor

Bangladesh receives $21+ billion in remittances annually, ranking among the top 5 globally. Most transfers come from Saudi Arabia, UAE, Malaysia, and the US. Traditional costs are high:

- Wire transfers: $20-40 + FX spreads
- Remittance services: 6-10% fees
- Delivery: 2-5 days

## Why Stablecoins for Bangladesh

Crypto adoption is growing despite regulatory challenges:
- High mobile money usage
- Diaspora seeking cheaper alternatives
- P2P networks establishing liquidity
- Interest in USD stability

## How to Send

1. **Buy USDC** on any exchange or on-ramp
2. **Send to Bangladeshi recipient** via Tempo (~$0.001 fee)
3. **Instant arrival** — recipient sees funds in seconds
4. **Convert to BDT** via P2P platforms when needed

## Off-Ramp Options

Bangladeshi recipients can access funds through:
- P2P marketplaces (most common)
- Regional exchanges
- Peer-to-peer trades
- Cross-border crypto services

## Cost Comparison

| Factor | Traditional | Tempo |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Speed | 2-5 days | <1 second |
| Cost | 6-10% | ~$0.001 |
| Access | Banking hours | 24/7 |
| FX Rate | Spread hidden | Transparent |

## The Difference This Makes

On a $300 monthly transfer:
- Traditional: $18-30 lost to fees per month ($216-360/year)
- Tempo: ~$0.001 per transfer (~$0.012/year)

For families depending on remittances, every dollar matters.
