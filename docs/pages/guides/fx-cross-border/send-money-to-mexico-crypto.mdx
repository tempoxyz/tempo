# Send Money to Mexico with Crypto

Send money to Mexico instantly using stablecoins on Tempo. Skip the 5-8% remittance fees and multi-day waits.

## The Mexico Corridor

The US-Mexico remittance corridor is the largest in the world, with over $60 billion sent annually. Traditional services charge 5-8% in fees.

On a $500 transfer:
- Traditional remittance: $25-40 in fees, 1-3 days
- Tempo: ~$0.001 in fees, <1 second

## How It Works

1. **Buy USDC** through Coinbase, your bank, or any exchange
2. **Send via Tempo** to your recipient's address (~$0.001 fee)
3. **Recipient converts** to MXN through local exchanges or services

## Off-Ramp Options in Mexico

Your recipient can convert USDC to Mexican Pesos through:
- Bitso and other Mexican exchanges
- P2P marketplaces
- Crypto-friendly banking apps
- Direct spending at accepting merchants

## Why Stablecoins Beat Traditional Remittances
