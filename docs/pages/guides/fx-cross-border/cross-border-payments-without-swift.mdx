# Cross-Border Payments Without SWIFT

Bypass the SWIFT network entirely. Send payments globally in seconds using stablecoins on Tempo.

## Why Businesses Are Moving Beyond SWIFT

SWIFT transfers take 1-5 business days, cost $25-50 per transaction, and require multiple correspondent banks. For businesses making frequent international payments, these delays and costs add up quickly.

Tempo offers a modern alternative: stablecoin rails that settle instantly with predictable, near-zero fees.

## Tempo's Advantages for Cross-Border Payments

| Feature | SWIFT | Tempo |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Settlement time | 1-5 days | <1 second |
| Cost per transfer | $25-50 | ~$0.001 |
| Operating hours | Banking hours | 24/7/365 |
| Transparency | Opaque routing | Full onchain visibility |
| Currency conversion | Bank FX rates | Direct stablecoin swaps |

## How It Works

Tempo provides dedicated payment lanes at the protocol level. Your payments don't compete with other blockchain traffic—fees stay low and predictable even during network congestion.

**Key features:**
- **Stablecoin-native gas**: Pay transaction fees in USD stablecoins, not volatile tokens
- **Payment metadata**: Attach invoice numbers, PO references, and cost centers directly to transactions
- **Deterministic finality**: Know exactly when your payment has settled, every time

## Getting Started

1. Set up your business wallet on Tempo
2. Fund with USDC, USDT, or other supported stablecoins
3. Send payments to any address globally
4. Reconcile with your existing ERP using onchain metadata
