# Send Money to Latin America with Stablecoins

Transfer money to any Latin American country instantly using USDC on Tempo. One solution for the entire region.

## Latin America Remittance Market

Latin America receives $150+ billion in remittances annually. Every corridor has the same problems:
- High fees (4-8%)
- Slow delivery (1-5 days)
- Limited hours
- Poor exchange rates

## Stablecoins: One Rail for All Countries

Send USDC on Tempo to recipients in:
- 🇲🇽 Mexico
- 🇧🇷 Brazil  
- 🇨🇴 Colombia
- 🇦🇷 Argentina
- 🇵🇪 Peru
- 🇨🇱 Chile
- 🇻🇪 Venezuela
- Any other country

Same process, same ~$0.001 fee, same instant delivery.

## How It Works

1. **Acquire USDC** through any exchange or on-ramp
2. **Send to recipient's Tempo address**
3. **Recipient converts** to local currency via local platforms

## Country-Specific Off-Ramps

| Country | Popular Off-Ramps |
|---------|-------------------|
| Mexico | Bitso, P2P markets |
| Brazil | Mercado Bitcoin, exchanges |
| Colombia | Buda, local exchanges |
| Argentina | P2P (popular due to FX controls) |
| Venezuela | P2P (primary method) |

## Why USDC Works Well in LATAM

- **Dollar preference**: Many prefer USD stability
- **Crypto adoption**: High familiarity with stablecoins
- **Banking gaps**: Crypto fills access gaps
- **P2P liquidity**: Active trading markets

## Use Cases

- **Family support**: Regular transfers home
- **Business payments**: Pay suppliers and contractors
- **Freelancer income**: Receive USD earnings
- **Savings**: Hold dollars without a US bank account
