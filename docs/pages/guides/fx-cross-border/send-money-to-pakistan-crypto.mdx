# Send Money to Pakistan with Crypto

Send money to Pakistan instantly using stablecoins on Tempo. Keep more money in your family's hands.

## Pakistan Remittance Corridor

Pakistan receives $30+ billion in remittances annually, ranking among the top 5 globally. Major sources include Saudi Arabia, UAE, UK, and the US. Traditional costs are substantial:

- Wire transfers: $25-45 + FX spreads
- Remittance services: 5-9% fees
- Delivery: 2-5 days

## Pakistan's Growing Crypto Scene

Crypto adoption is rising despite regulatory uncertainty:
- Active P2P trading community
- High diaspora engagement
- Mobile-first population
- Interest in hedging PKR volatility

## How to Send

1. **Buy USDC** on any exchange or on-ramp
2. **Send to Pakistani recipient** via Tempo (~$0.001 fee)
3. **Instant arrival** — recipient sees funds in seconds
4. **Convert to PKR** via P2P platforms when needed

## Off-Ramp Options

Pakistani recipients can convert stablecoins through:
- P2P marketplaces (most liquid option)
- Regional trading platforms
- Peer-to-peer networks
- Cross-border crypto services

## Cost Comparison

| Factor | Traditional | Tempo |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Speed | 2-5 days | <1 second |
| Cost | 5-9% | ~$0.001 |
| Access | Banking hours | 24/7 |
| FX Rate | Spread hidden | Transparent |

## Real Impact

On a $500 monthly transfer:
- Traditional: $25-45 lost to fees per month ($300-540/year)
- Tempo: ~$0.001 per transfer (~$0.012/year)

That's enough to cover a month of groceries saved each year.
