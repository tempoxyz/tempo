# Send USDC to Europe

Send USDC to recipients in Europe instantly on Tempo. Convert to EURC if needed using the built-in stablecoin DEX.

## Fast, Cheap Transfers to Europe

Whether you're paying a European vendor, sending money to family, or funding an EU business account, Tempo makes it simple:

- **Instant settlement**: ~0.5 second finality
- **Sub-cent fees**: ~$0.001 per transaction
- **Optional EUR conversion**: Swap USDC → EURC onchain before sending
- **No banking delays**: 24/7 availability, no SWIFT, no correspondent banks

## Two Options for European Recipients

### Option 1: Send USDC Directly
If your recipient accepts USD stablecoins, send USDC directly to their Tempo address. They can hold it, swap it, or off-ramp through their preferred provider.

### Option 2: Convert to EURC First
Use Tempo's native DEX to swap USDC → EURC before sending:
1. Swap USDC to EURC on the stablecoin DEX
2. Send EURC to your recipient
3. They receive EUR-denominated stablecoins ready for local off-ramp

Both options settle in under a second with minimal fees.

## Why Tempo Over Traditional Rails

|--------|------|------|--------------|
| Bank wire (SWIFT) | 1-5 days | $25-50 | Banking hours |
| Tempo | <1 second | ~$0.001 | 24/7 |
