# Convert USD to EUR Without Bank Fees

Swap between USD and EUR stablecoins instantly on Tempo's built-in DEX—no forex spreads, no hidden fees, no bank intermediaries.

## The Problem with Traditional FX

Banks and forex services charge 1-3% on currency conversions, plus hidden spreads. A $10,000 transfer can cost $100-300 in fees alone. Tempo eliminates this with direct stablecoin-to-stablecoin swaps.

## How Tempo's Stablecoin DEX Works

Tempo includes a native decentralized exchange optimized specifically for stablecoins. Swap USDC to EURC (or any supported stablecoin pair) with:

- **Minimal slippage**: Liquidity consolidated into a single onchain system
- **Sub-cent fees**: Pay ~$0.001 per swap regardless of size
- **No intermediaries**: Direct peer-to-pool swaps, no counterparty risk
- **Instant settlement**: Swaps finalize in ~0.5 seconds

## Supported Currency Pairs

- USD stablecoins: USDC, USDT, DAI, PYUSD
- EUR stablecoins: EURC
- Additional currencies coming soon

## Steps to Convert

1. Connect your wallet to Tempo
2. Navigate to the stablecoin DEX
3. Select your source currency (e.g., USDC) and target (e.g., EURC)
4. Enter amount and confirm—done in seconds
