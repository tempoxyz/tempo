# Send Money to India with Stablecoins

Transfer money to India instantly using USDC on Tempo. Avoid wire fees and forex spreads.

## India Remittance Market

India receives over $100 billion in remittances annually—the largest in the world. Yet fees remain high:
- Bank wires: $25-50 + 2-3% FX spread
- Remittance services: 3-5% total cost
- 2-5 day delivery times

## Stablecoin Alternative

Send USDC on Tempo:
- **Fee**: ~$0.001 per transfer
- **Speed**: <1 second
- **Availability**: 24/7, no bank holidays

## Step-by-Step

1. **Acquire USDC** on any major exchange
2. **Send to recipient's Tempo address** 
3. **Recipient off-ramps to INR** via Indian crypto platforms

## Converting to INR

Options for your recipient:
- WazirX, CoinDCX, and other Indian exchanges
- P2P trading platforms
- UPI-integrated crypto services

## Considerations

- Indian crypto regulations evolve—recipients should use compliant platforms
- Tax implications may apply on crypto-to-INR conversions
- VDA (Virtual Digital Asset) framework governs crypto in India

## Cost Comparison

| Amount | Bank Wire | Remittance Service | Tempo |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| $500 | ~$45 | ~$25 | ~$0.001 |
