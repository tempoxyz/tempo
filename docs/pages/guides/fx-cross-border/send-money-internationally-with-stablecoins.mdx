# Send Money Internationally with Stablecoins

Send money across borders instantly using stablecoins on Tempo—no banks, no wire fees, no 3-5 business day waits.

## Why Tempo for International Transfers

Traditional international transfers through SWIFT or correspondent banks take days and cost $25-50 in fees. Tempo settles cross-border payments in under a second for less than a tenth of a cent.

**Key advantages:**
- **Instant finality**: Transactions settle in ~0.5 seconds with deterministic confirmation
- **Near-zero fees**: Target cost of $0.001 per transaction regardless of amount
- **Stablecoin-native**: Send USDC, USDT, or other USD stablecoins without needing volatile crypto for gas
- **24/7 availability**: No banking hours, no holidays, no cutoff times

## How It Works

1. Connect your wallet to Tempo
2. Select your stablecoin (USDC, USDT, DAI, etc.)
3. Enter the recipient's address and amount
4. Confirm the transaction—settled in under a second

Recipients can hold the stablecoins or convert to local currency through any supported off-ramp.

## Use Cases

- Send money to family abroad
- Pay international freelancers
- Fund overseas business operations
- Emergency transfers without banking delays
