# Send Money to Ghana with Crypto

Send money to Ghana instantly using stablecoins on Tempo. Stop losing money to excessive remittance fees.

## Ghana Remittance Corridor

Ghana receives $4.5+ billion in remittances annually, representing a significant portion of GDP. Major sources include the US, UK, and European countries. Traditional costs are extremely high:

- Wire transfers: $30-50 + FX spreads
- Remittance services: 8-12% fees
- Delivery: 2-5 days

## Ghana's Crypto Adoption

Ghana has embraced crypto as an alternative:
- Growing P2P trading community
- High mobile penetration
- Active fintech ecosystem
- Interest in USD stability amid cedi volatility

## How to Send

1. **Buy USDC** on any exchange or on-ramp
2. **Send to Ghanaian recipient** via Tempo (~$0.001 fee)
3. **Instant arrival** — recipient sees funds in seconds
4. **Convert to GHS** via local platforms when needed

## Off-Ramp Options

Ghanaian recipients can convert stablecoins through:
- P2P platforms (growing liquidity)
- Regional exchanges
- Mobile money bridges
- Peer-to-peer networks

## Cost Comparison

| Factor | Traditional | Tempo |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Speed | 2-5 days | <1 second |
| Cost | 8-12% | ~$0.001 |
| Access | Banking hours | 24/7 |
| FX Rate | Spread hidden | Transparent |

## The Impact of High Fees

On a $400 monthly transfer:
- Traditional: $32-48 lost to fees per month ($384-576/year)
- Tempo: ~$0.001 per transfer (~$0.012/year)

That's potentially half a year's school fees saved annually.
