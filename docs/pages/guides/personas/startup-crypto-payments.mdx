# Startup Crypto Payments Guide

A practical guide for startups adopting stablecoin payments—whether you're paying contractors, accepting customer payments, or managing treasury.

## Why Startups Choose Stablecoins

### Cost Savings

Every dollar matters at a startup. Payment fees add up:

| Monthly Payments | Wire Fees | ACH Fees | Tempo Fees | Annual Savings |
|------------------|-----------|----------|------------|----------------|
| 50 contractors | $1,500 | $50 | $0.05 | $17,940 |
| 200 customers | $6,000 | $200 | $0.20 | $71,760 |

### Global by Default

Pay anyone, anywhere:

- **Remote contractors** — Pay developers in Argentina, designers in Poland, same as local
- **International customers** — Accept payments without Stripe Atlas complexity
- **No banking restrictions** — Countries with limited banking infrastructure can still transact

### Speed

- Traditional wire: 3-5 business days
- ACH: 2-3 business days
- Tempo: ~0.5 seconds

## Common Startup Use Cases

### Paying Contractors

Most startups start here. Pay your global team in stablecoins:

```typescript
import { Tempo } from '@tempo/sdk';

const tempo = new Tempo({ apiKey: 'your-api-key' });

// Pay contractor
await tempo.payments.create({
  recipient: contractor.walletAddress,
  amount: '5000.00',
  currency: 'USDC',
  metadata: {
    contractorId: contractor.id,
    period: '2024-01',
    type: 'monthly-retainer'
  }
});
```

Contractors receive funds instantly. They can:
- Hold USDC
- Convert to local currency via exchange
- Spend directly where crypto is accepted

### Accepting Customer Payments

Add stablecoin checkout to your product:

```typescript
// Create payment link for customer
const invoice = await tempo.invoices.create({
  amount: '999.00',
  currency: 'USDC',
  customer: {
    email: customer.email,
    name: customer.name
  },
  metadata: {
    plan: 'annual-pro',
    customerId: customer.id
  }
});

// Send payment link
await sendEmail(customer.email, {
  subject: 'Your Invoice',
  paymentLink: invoice.paymentUrl
});
```

### Treasury Management

Keep operating capital in stablecoins:

```typescript
// Check balance
const balance = await tempo.accounts.getBalance(companyWallet);

// Earn yield on idle funds
await tempo.yield.deploy({
  amount: balance * 0.5, // Deploy 50% to yield
  strategy: 'money-market',
  currency: 'USDC'
});
```

## Getting Started

### Week 1: Setup

1. **Create Tempo account** — Sign up at tempo.xyz
2. **Fund your wallet** — Transfer USDC from exchange or bank on-ramp
3. **Collect contractor wallets** — Ask contractors for their wallet addresses

### Week 2: First Payments

1. **Test payment** — Send small amount to verify addresses
2. **Batch payment** — Process contractor payments
3. **Document process** — Create runbook for regular payments

### Week 3+: Expand

- Add customer payment acceptance
- Integrate with your invoicing system
- Set up recurring payment schedules

## Integration Patterns

### Simple: Manual Payments

Use Tempo dashboard for occasional payments. Good for:
- Monthly contractor payments
- Ad-hoc vendor payments
- Early-stage startups

### Intermediate: API Integration

Connect your systems to Tempo API:

```typescript
// Integrate with your contractor management system
app.post('/pay-contractors', async (req, res) => {
  const contractors = await getActiveContractors();
  
  const batch = await tempo.batch.create({
    payments: contractors.map(c => ({
      recipient: c.walletAddress,
      amount: c.monthlyRate,
      currency: 'USDC',
      metadata: { contractorId: c.id }
    }))
  });
  
  return res.json({ batchId: batch.id, count: contractors.length });
});
```

### Advanced: Full Automation

Automate end-to-end:

- Invoice generation triggers payment request
- Payment confirmation updates your systems
- Reconciliation happens automatically via webhooks

## Common Questions

### Do contractors need crypto knowledge?

Minimal. They need a wallet address—Tempo smart accounts use passkeys (like FaceID), not seed phrases.

### How do contractors convert to local currency?

They can use any exchange (Coinbase, Kraken, local exchanges) or off-ramp services. Many prefer holding USDC.

### What about taxes?

Same reporting requirements as any contractor payment. Tempo provides transaction records with metadata for your records.

### Is this legal?

Stablecoin payments are legal in most jurisdictions. Consult your lawyer for specific situations, especially for employees vs contractors.
