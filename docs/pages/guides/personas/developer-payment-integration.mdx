# Developer Guide to Payment Integration

Build stablecoin payment flows into your application with Tempo's developer tools.

## Why Developers Choose Tempo

- **Simple APIs** — RESTful endpoints and typed SDKs
- **Fast finality** — Confirm payments in ~0.5 seconds, no polling for confirmations
- **Rich metadata** — Attach structured data to every transaction
- **Predictable costs** — Sub-cent fees that don't fluctuate

## Integration Overview

### Payment Flow

1. Generate a payment request with amount and metadata
2. Customer sends payment to provided address
3. Webhook notifies your server of payment receipt
4. Verify payment details and fulfill order

### Key APIs

- **Addresses** — Generate unique receiving addresses
- **Transactions** — Query payment status and history
- **Webhooks** — Real-time payment notifications
- **Metadata** — Attach and retrieve payment references

## Quick Start

### Install the SDK

```bash
npm install @tempo/sdk
```

### Create a Payment Request

```typescript
import { Tempo } from '@tempo/sdk';

const tempo = new Tempo({ apiKey: 'your-api-key' });

const payment = await tempo.payments.create({
  amount: '100.00',
  currency: 'USDC',
  metadata: {
    orderId: 'order-123',
    customerId: 'cust-456'
  }
});
```

### Handle Webhooks

```typescript
app.post('/webhooks/tempo', (req, res) => {
  const event = tempo.webhooks.verify(req.body, req.headers);
  
  if (event.type === 'payment.received') {
    // Fulfill order
  }
});
```
