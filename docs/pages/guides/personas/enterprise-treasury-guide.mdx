# Enterprise Treasury Guide

A guide for CFOs and treasury teams evaluating stablecoins for corporate cash management, payments, and yield optimization.

## Why Treasury Teams Consider Stablecoins

### Cash Management Challenges

| Challenge | Traditional Approach | Stablecoin Approach |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Idle cash yield | 0-2% in bank accounts | 3-5% in DeFi protocols |
| International transfers | $30-50, 2-5 days | ~$0.001, instant |
| Operating hours | Banking hours only | 24/7/365 |
| Visibility | T+1 bank statements | Real-time on-chain |

### Tempo for Treasury

Tempo provides enterprise-grade infrastructure:

- **Multi-signature controls** — Require multiple approvers for transactions
- **Spending limits** — Enforce daily/weekly transaction caps
- **Audit trail** — Immutable record of all treasury operations
- **Stablecoin-native gas** — No volatile asset management required

## Treasury Operations

### Multi-Sig Configuration

Set up approval thresholds appropriate for your organization:

```typescript
import { Tempo } from '@tempo/sdk';

const tempo = new Tempo({ apiKey: 'your-api-key' });

// Create treasury account with multi-sig
const treasury = await tempo.accounts.create({
  type: 'multi-sig',
  signers: [
    { address: cfo.wallet, weight: 2 },
    { address: controller.wallet, weight: 1 },
    { address: treasurer.wallet, weight: 1 }
  ],
  thresholds: {
    default: 2,           // 2 weight required normally
    highValue: 3          // 3 weight for large transactions
  },
  limits: {
    highValueThreshold: '100000.00'
  }
});
```

### Payment Approval Workflow

1. Treasury analyst initiates payment
2. System routes to appropriate approvers based on amount
3. Approvers sign via hardware wallet or passkey
4. Payment executes when threshold met
5. Confirmation recorded with full audit trail

### Cash Position Visibility

Real-time view of stablecoin holdings:

```typescript
// Get treasury positions
const positions = await tempo.accounts.getBalances(treasury.address);

// Returns:
{
  USDC: '2,500,000.00',
  USDT: '1,200,000.00',
  totalUSD: '3,700,000.00',
  lastUpdated: '2024-01-15T14:32:00Z'
}
```

## Yield Optimization

### Stablecoin Yield Strategies

Deploy idle cash to earn yield while maintaining liquidity:

| Strategy | Expected Yield | Liquidity | Risk Level |
|----------|---------------|-----------|------------|
| Money market protocols | 3-5% | Instant | Low |
| Liquidity provision | 5-10% | Minutes | Medium |
| Term deposits | 6-12% | Locked | Low-Medium |

### Treasury Allocation Example

```
Total Treasury: $10M USDC

Allocation:
├── Operating Buffer (20%): $2M — Instant access, 0% yield
├── Short-term (50%): $5M — Money market, 4% yield
└── Medium-term (30%): $3M — Term deposit, 7% yield

Blended Yield: 4.1% ($410K annually)
```

### Tempo Yield Integration

```typescript
// Deploy to yield strategy
const deployment = await tempo.yield.deploy({
  amount: '5000000.00',
  currency: 'USDC',
  strategy: 'money-market',
  autoCompound: true,
  minYield: 0.03 // 3% minimum
});

// Check current yield
const status = await tempo.yield.getPosition(deployment.id);
// Returns current balance, accrued yield, APY
```

## Payments and Settlements

### Vendor Payments

Execute batch payments with full metadata:

```typescript
const batch = await tempo.batch.create({
  account: treasury.address,
  payments: approvedPayables.map(inv => ({
    recipient: inv.vendor.wallet,
    amount: inv.amount,
    currency: 'USDC',
    metadata: {
      invoiceNumber: inv.number,
      vendorId: inv.vendorId,
      glCode: inv.glCode,
      costCenter: inv.costCenter
    }
  })),
  requiredApprovals: 2
});
```

### Intercompany Transfers

Move funds between subsidiaries instantly:

```typescript
await tempo.payments.create({
  from: treasury.address,
  recipient: subsidiary.treasury.address,
  amount: '500000.00',
  currency: 'USDC',
  metadata: {
    type: 'intercompany-transfer',
    fromEntity: 'US-HQ',
    toEntity: 'EU-Sub',
    purpose: 'Q1-operating-capital'
  }
});
```

## Compliance and Controls

### Audit Trail

Every transaction is recorded on-chain with:

- Timestamp
- Signers who approved
- Full metadata
- Immutable transaction hash

### Reporting

Generate reports for auditors and regulators:

```typescript
const report = await tempo.reports.generate({
  account: treasury.address,
  startDate: '2024-01-01',
  endDate: '2024-03-31',
  format: 'csv',
  include: ['transactions', 'approvals', 'balances']
});
```

### Segregation of Duties

- Analysts can initiate, not approve
- Approvers cannot initiate
- Separate signers required for high-value transactions

## Getting Started

### Pilot Program

1. Fund a small treasury account ($100K-500K)
2. Execute vendor payments for select suppliers
3. Measure cost savings and operational efficiency
4. Expand based on results

### Integration Points

- ERP integration for AP/AR workflows
- Banking API for on/off-ramp automation
- Accounting system for reconciliation
