# How to Pay with Stablecoins

Use Tempo to pay invoices, subscriptions, and vendors with USDC or USDT.

## Prerequisites

- A Tempo wallet with stablecoin balance
- Payment details (address, amount, any required references)

## Paying an Invoice

### 1. Get Payment Details

Your vendor provides:

- Their Tempo address
- Amount due
- Invoice reference (optional but recommended)

### 2. Initiate Payment

Open the Tempo app and start a new transfer:

- **To** — Vendor's Tempo address
- **Amount** — Invoice amount
- **Metadata** — Invoice number, PO reference, etc.

### 3. Confirm Payment

Review details and confirm. The payment finalizes in ~0.5 seconds.

### 4. Share Confirmation

Send the transaction ID to your vendor as payment confirmation.

## Attaching Payment Metadata

Include references to streamline accounting:

```
Invoice: INV-2024-001234
Vendor ID: V-5678
Description: Q4 Software License
```

This metadata is stored on-chain and can be read by accounting integrations.

## Recurring Payments

For subscriptions, set up scheduled payments through the Tempo API.
