# How to Accept Crypto Payments

Accept stablecoin payments from customers with instant settlement and automatic reconciliation.

## Integration Options

Choose the approach that fits your business:

### Option 1: Simple Wallet Address

Share your Tempo address for customers to send payments directly. Best for:

- Freelancers and contractors
- Small businesses
- Invoice-based billing

### Option 2: Payment Links

Generate unique payment links with pre-filled amounts and metadata:

```
https://pay.tempo.xyz/to/YOUR_ADDRESS?amount=100&currency=USDC&ref=INV-001
```

### Option 3: API Integration

Full programmatic control for automated payment processing:

- Generate unique addresses per transaction
- Webhook notifications on payment receipt
- Automatic metadata extraction
- Multi-currency support

## Setup Steps
