# DAI on Tempo

DAI is a decentralized stablecoin created by MakerDAO. On Tempo, you can send DAI with sub-cent fees, pay gas in stablecoins, and swap between currencies instantly.

## What is DAI?

DAI is a decentralized, crypto-collateralized stablecoin soft-pegged to the US dollar. MakerDAO governs the protocol, and users mint DAI by depositing collateral into Maker Vaults. The system maintains the peg through overcollateralization and automated stability mechanisms.

**Key facts:**
- **Issuer:** MakerDAO (decentralized governance)
- **Backing:** Overcollateralized crypto assets, real-world assets, and USDC
- **Peg:** 1 DAI ≈ 1 USD (soft peg maintained by protocol mechanisms)
- **Governance:** MKR token holders govern protocol parameters
