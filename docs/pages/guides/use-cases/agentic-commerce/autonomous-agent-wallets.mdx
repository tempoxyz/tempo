# Autonomous Agent Wallets

AI agents need financial autonomy to operate effectively. Tempo smart accounts provide the infrastructure for agents to hold, send, and receive payments independently.

## The Agent Wallet Challenge

Traditional payment infrastructure wasn't built for autonomous software:

| Requirement | Traditional Systems | Tempo Smart Accounts |
|-------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Programmatic access | API keys with full access | Granular permissions |
| Spending controls | Limited | Programmable limits |
| Transaction costs | High minimums | ~$0.001 per transaction |
| Setup | Manual KYC process | Instant creation |

## Tempo Smart Accounts for Agents

### Self-Sovereign Design

Each agent controls its own wallet with cryptographic keys:

- **Independent operation** — Agents transact without human intervention
- **Verifiable identity** — On-chain address serves as agent identity
- **Portable balance** — Funds move with the agent across platforms

### Programmable Constraints

Configure guardrails for agent spending:

```typescript
import { Tempo } from '@tempo/sdk';

const tempo = new Tempo({ apiKey: 'your-api-key' });

// Create agent wallet with spending limits
const agentWallet = await tempo.accounts.create({
  type: 'smart-account',
  constraints: {
    maxTransactionAmount: '100.00',
    dailySpendLimit: '500.00',
    allowedRecipients: ['0x...service1', '0x...service2'],
    requireMetadata: ['purpose', 'taskId']
  }
});
```

### Passkey Security

Secure agent wallets with hardware-backed authentication:

- No private keys to manage or leak
- Revocable access
- Audit trail of all operations

## Agent Wallet Patterns

### Funded Task Execution

1. System deposits funds for specific task
2. Agent spends within allocated budget
3. Unused funds return to treasury

```typescript
// Fund agent for specific task
await tempo.payments.create({
  recipient: agentWallet.address,
  amount: '50.00',
  currency: 'USDC',
  metadata: {
    taskId: 'task-789',
    purpose: 'research-budget'
  }
});

// Agent executes payments for task
await agentWallet.pay({
  recipient: dataProvider.address,
  amount: '5.00',
  currency: 'USDC',
  metadata: {
    taskId: 'task-789',
    service: 'data-query'
  }
});
```

### Revenue Collection

Agents can receive payments for services rendered:

```typescript
// Agent publishes payment address
const paymentAddress = agentWallet.address;

// Webhook notifies agent of incoming payment
agentWallet.on('payment.received', async (event) => {
  const { amount, metadata } = event;
  await executeServiceFor(metadata.requestId);
});
```

### Multi-Agent Coordination

Agents can transact with each other:

```typescript
// Agent A pays Agent B for sub-task
await agentA.wallet.pay({
  recipient: agentB.wallet.address,
  amount: '10.00',
  currency: 'USDC',
  metadata: {
    taskId: 'task-789',
    subTask: 'data-processing'
  }
});
```

## Security Model

### Hierarchical Control

```
Organization Treasury
    └── Agent Pool Budget
        └── Individual Agent Wallets
            └── Per-Task Allocations
```

### Constraint Enforcement

- **Transaction limits** — Cap individual payment amounts
- **Daily/weekly budgets** — Limit cumulative spending
- **Allowlists** — Restrict recipient addresses
- **Metadata requirements** — Enforce payment documentation

### Emergency Controls

- Pause agent wallet instantly
- Revoke spending permissions
- Recover remaining funds

## Observability

### Transaction Monitoring

Track all agent financial activity:

```typescript
const transactions = await tempo.transactions.list({
  account: agentWallet.address,
  startDate: '2024-01-01',
  endDate: '2024-01-31'
});

// Analyze spending patterns
const byPurpose = groupBy(transactions, t => t.metadata.purpose);
```

### Webhook Events

Real-time notifications for:

- Incoming payments
- Outgoing payments
- Spending limit warnings
- Constraint violations
