# Gaming Micropayments

Power in-game economies with stablecoin micropayments. Tempo's sub-cent fees and instant finality enable new monetization models for games of all sizes.

## Gaming Payment Challenges

Current in-game payment systems have limitations:

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Platform fees | 30% to app stores on every purchase |
| Minimum transactions | Can't sell $0.10 items profitably |
| Cross-platform wallets | Balances locked to single platform |
| Player trading | Complex to enable, often prohibited |

## Tempo for Gaming

### Sub-Cent Transaction Fees

Sell items at any price point:

| Item | Price | Tempo Fee | Developer Keeps |
|------|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| Common skin | $0.10 | ~$0.001 | $0.099 (99%) |
| Consumable | $0.25 | ~$0.001 | $0.249 (99.6%) |
| Battle pass | $10.00 | ~$0.001 | $9.999 (99.99%) |

Compare to 30% platform fees where developers keep only 70%.

### Instant Finality

Transactions confirm in ~0.5 seconds. Players see purchases immediately—no waiting for payment confirmation.

### Player-Owned Assets

Players hold items in their own wallets. True ownership enables:

- Cross-game asset portability
- Player-to-player trading
- Secondary market participation

## Implementation

### In-Game Purchases

```typescript
import { Tempo } from '@tempo/sdk';

const tempo = new Tempo({ apiKey: 'your-api-key' });

// Purchase in-game item
async function purchaseItem(playerId, itemId) {
  const player = await getPlayer(playerId);
  const item = await getItem(itemId);
  
  const payment = await tempo.payments.charge({
    from: player.walletAddress,
    amount: item.price,
    currency: 'USDC',
    metadata: {
      playerId,
      itemId,
      itemName: item.name,
      gameId: 'game-123'
    }
  });
  
  if (payment.confirmed) {
    await grantItem(playerId, itemId);
    return { success: true, item };
  }
}
```

### Player-to-Player Trading

```typescript
// Escrow-based trading
async function executeTrade(trade) {
  const { sellerId, buyerId, itemId, price } = trade;
  
  // Charge buyer
  const payment = await tempo.payments.create({
    from: buyers[buyerId].wallet,
    recipient: sellers[sellerId].wallet,
    amount: price,
    currency: 'USDC',
    metadata: {
      tradeId: trade.id,
      itemId,
      type: 'player-trade'
    }
  });
  
  if (payment.confirmed) {
    // Transfer item ownership
    await transferItem(itemId, sellerId, buyerId);
    return { success: true };
  }
}
```

### Streaming Payments for Play Time

Charge per minute or per session:

```typescript
// Start play session
async function startSession(playerId) {
  const session = {
    playerId,
    startTime: Date.now(),
    chargedMinutes: 0
  };
  
  // Charge every minute
  const interval = setInterval(async () => {
    await tempo.payments.charge({
      from: players[playerId].wallet,
      amount: '0.01', // $0.01 per minute
      currency: 'USDC',
      metadata: {
        playerId,
        sessionId: session.id,
        minute: session.chargedMinutes++
      }
    });
  }, 60000);
  
  return { sessionId: session.id, stop: () => clearInterval(interval) };
}
```

### Loot Box / Gacha with Transparency

On-chain randomness for provably fair drops:

```typescript
async function openLootBox(playerId, boxType) {
  const player = await getPlayer(playerId);
  const boxPrice = lootBoxPrices[boxType];
  
  // Charge for loot box
  const payment = await tempo.payments.charge({
    from: player.walletAddress,
    amount: boxPrice,
    currency: 'USDC',
    metadata: { playerId, boxType, type: 'loot-box' }
  });
  
  // Generate verifiable random drop
  const drop = await generateDrop(boxType, payment.txHash);
  
  await grantItem(playerId, drop.itemId);
  
  return {
    item: drop,
    txHash: payment.txHash, // Proof of fairness
    dropRate: drop.probability
  };
}
```

## Economy Design Patterns

### Dual Currency

Combine stablecoins with in-game soft currency:

```typescript
// Hard currency (USDC) for premium items
// Soft currency (gold) earned through play

async function purchaseWithGold(playerId, itemId) {
  // Earned currency, no blockchain transaction needed
  return deductGold(playerId, item.goldPrice);
}

async function purchaseWithUSDC(playerId, itemId) {
  // Premium purchase via Tempo
  return purchaseItem(playerId, itemId);
}
```

### Marketplace Fees

Take a cut of player-to-player trades:

```typescript
async function marketplaceSale(listing) {
  const salePrice = listing.price;
  const platformFee = salePrice * 0.05; // 5% marketplace fee
  const sellerReceives = salePrice - platformFee;
  
  // Buyer pays full price
  await tempo.payments.charge({
    from: listing.buyerWallet,
    amount: salePrice
  });
  
  // Seller receives minus fee
  await tempo.payments.create({
    recipient: listing.sellerWallet,
    amount: sellerReceives
  });
}
```
