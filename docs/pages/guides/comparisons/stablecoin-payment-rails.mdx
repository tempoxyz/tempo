# Stablecoin Payment Rails Comparison

A technical overview of infrastructure options for stablecoin payments.

## Comparison Matrix

| Feature | Tempo | Ethereum L1 | Optimistic L2s | Other L2s | Traditional Rails |
|---------|-------|-------------|----------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Finality** | ~0.5s | ~12min | 7 days* | 1-10min | 1-3 days |
| **Transaction Fee** | ~$0.001 | $1-50+ | $0.01-0.50 | $0.01-0.50 | $0.30 + 2.9% |
| **Gas Token** | Stablecoins | ETH | ETH | Various | N/A |
| **Payment Metadata** | Native | Limited | Limited | Limited | Yes |
| **Guaranteed Blockspace** | Yes | No | No | No | N/A |

*Optimistic rollups have 7-day withdrawal windows; soft finality is faster.

## Tempo Advantages

### Stablecoin-Native Gas

Pay fees in USDC or USDT. No need to acquire and manage a volatile gas token.

### True Instant Finality

~0.5 second deterministic finality. No confirmation counting, no reorg risk, no withdrawal delays.

### Payment-First Design

Native metadata support, dedicated payment lanes, and APIs designed for payment use cases rather than general-purpose smart contracts.

### Predictable Economics

Sub-cent fees that don't spike during network congestion.

## When to Use What

| Use Case | Recommended Rail |
|----------|------------------|
| High-value DeFi | Ethereum L1 |
| General-purpose L2 apps | Optimistic/ZK L2s |
| **Payment processing** | **Tempo** |
| **Micropayments** | **Tempo** |
| **Business payments** | **Tempo** |
