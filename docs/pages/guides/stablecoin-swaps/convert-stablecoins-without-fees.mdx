# Convert Stablecoins With Near-Zero Fees

Traditional stablecoin swaps cost $5–$50+ on Ethereum mainnet. Tempo reduces this to ~$0.001 per transaction—making frequent, small-value conversions economically viable.

## How Tempo Achieves Near-Zero Fees

### Payment-Optimized Architecture

Tempo is purpose-built for payment workloads, with fee structures designed for high-frequency, low-value transactions rather than DeFi speculation.

### ~$0.001 Per Transaction

Each stablecoin swap costs approximately one-tenth of a cent, regardless of swap size.

### Stablecoin-Native Gas

Pay fees in the stablecoins you're already using. No need to acquire ETH, manage multiple token balances, or worry about gas price volatility.

| **Tempo** | ~$0.001 |
