# Best Stablecoin Exchange: Comparing Your Options

When converting between stablecoins, your choice of exchange directly impacts costs, speed, and user experience. Here's how Tempo's built-in DEX compares to alternatives.

## Comparison Overview

| Feature | Tempo DEX | CEX | Ethereum DEX | L2 DEX |
|---------|-----------|-----|--------------|--------|
| Transaction Fee | ~$0.001 | $0–$5+ | $5–$50+ | $0.10–$1 |
| Settlement Time | ~0.5s | Minutes–Hours | 12+ seconds | 2–10 seconds |
| Gas Token | Stablecoins | N/A | ETH required | ETH required |
| Custody | Self-custody | Custodial | Self-custody | Self-custody |
| KYC Required | No | Yes | No | No |

## Why Tempo's DEX Stands Out

### Near-Zero Fees (~$0.001)

Tempo's payment-optimized architecture keeps transaction costs at fractions of a cent, making small and frequent swaps economically viable.

### Sub-Second Settlement (~0.5s)

Transactions finalize in under a second, enabling real-time payment workflows without waiting for block confirmations.

### Stablecoin-Native Gas

Pay transaction fees in stablecoins directly. No need to acquire, hold, or manage ETH for gas—simplifying treasury operations and user onboarding.

### Built-In Liquidity

Tempo's DEX is native to the protocol, eliminating bridge risks and third-party dependencies.
