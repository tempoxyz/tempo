# Payment Metadata

Tempo supports rich metadata attached directly to transactions—invoice numbers, purchase order references, customer IDs, and more.

## The Problem with Traditional Crypto Payments

Most blockchains treat payments as simple value transfers. Matching payments to invoices requires off-chain systems and manual reconciliation.

## Tempo's Solution

Attach structured metadata directly to transactions:

- **Invoice numbers** — Link payments to specific invoices automatically
- **PO references** — Connect to purchase orders in your procurement system
- **Customer IDs** — Associate payments with customer accounts
- **Custom fields** — Add any data your business needs

## Integration Benefits

- **Automatic reconciliation** — Payments match to records without manual work
- **ERP integration** — Sync directly with SAP, NetSuite, QuickBooks, and others
- **Audit trails** — Complete payment context stored on-chain
- **Reduced disputes** — Clear documentation of what each payment was for

## Get Started

See the metadata API in the [Tempo documentation](https://docs.tempo.xyz).
