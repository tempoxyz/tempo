# Instant Finality

Tempo transactions reach finality in approximately 0.5 seconds. Once confirmed, they're irreversible—no reorgs, no waiting for additional blocks.

## What Is Finality?

Finality means a transaction cannot be reversed or reorganized. On many blockchains, you wait for multiple confirmations to be confident a transaction won't be undone.

## Tempo's Approach

Tempo uses deterministic finality. When a transaction is included in a block, it's final. Period.

- **~0.5 second confirmation** — Near-instant settlement
- **No confirmation counting** — One block is enough
- **No reorg risk** — Transactions can't be reversed by chain reorganization

## Why It Matters

- **Point-of-sale payments** — Customers don't wait at the register
- **Trading** — Execute strategies that require fast settlement
- **Cross-border payments** — Money arrives in under a second, not days
