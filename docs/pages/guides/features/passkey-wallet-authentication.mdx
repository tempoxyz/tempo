# Passkey Wallet Authentication

Tempo supports passkey-based wallets, letting you sign transactions with Face ID, Touch ID, or Windows Hello—no seed phrases required.

## What Are Passkeys?

Passkeys are cryptographic credentials stored securely on your device and protected by biometrics. They're the same technology you use to unlock your phone or log into websites without passwords.

## Benefits

- **Familiar UX** — Use the same Face ID or Touch ID you already know
- **No seed phrases** — Nothing to write down or lose
- **Phishing resistant** — Passkeys are bound to specific domains
- **Device security** — Keys never leave your secure enclave

## How It Works

1. Create a wallet using your device's biometric authentication
2. Your private key is generated and stored in the secure enclave
3. Sign transactions by authenticating with Face ID or Touch ID
4. Keys sync across your devices via iCloud Keychain or similar

## Getting Started

Set up a passkey wallet using the [Tempo documentation](https://docs.tempo.xyz).
