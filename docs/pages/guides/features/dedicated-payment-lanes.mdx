# Dedicated Payment Lanes

Tempo guarantees blockspace for payment transactions, ensuring reliable processing regardless of overall network activity.

## The Congestion Problem

On most blockchains, all transactions compete for the same blockspace. During high demand, fees spike and transactions get stuck. NFT mints shouldn't delay your payroll.

## How Payment Lanes Work

Tempo reserves a portion of each block specifically for payment transactions. This dedicated capacity means:

- **Consistent processing** — Payments go through even during congestion
- **Predictable fees** — Payment fees stay stable
- **Priority when it matters** — Business-critical transactions aren't delayed

## Use Cases

- **Payroll processing** — Employee payments process on schedule
- **Vendor settlements** — Pay suppliers without delays
- **Customer refunds** — Process refunds promptly
- **Subscription billing** — Recurring payments execute reliably
