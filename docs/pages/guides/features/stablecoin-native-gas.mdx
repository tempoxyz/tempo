# Stablecoin-Native Gas Fees

Tempo eliminates the need to hold volatile cryptocurrencies just to pay transaction fees. Pay gas directly in USDC or USDT.

## How It Works

Traditional blockchains require you to hold their native token (ETH, SOL, etc.) to pay for transactions. Tempo flips this model—use the same stablecoins you're already sending and receiving.

## Benefits

- **No token management** — Stop juggling multiple tokens just to move money
- **Predictable costs** — Fees stay stable in dollar terms
- **Simpler onboarding** — New users don't need to acquire a separate gas token
- **Better for business** — Expense reporting and accounting are straightforward
