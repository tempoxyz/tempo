# Sub-Cent Transaction Fees

Tempo's fees average around $0.001 per transaction, making previously impractical use cases economically viable.

## Why Low Fees Matter

High transaction fees on other networks make small payments impossible. A $5 coffee shouldn't cost $2 in fees.

## Use Cases Enabled

- **Micropayments** — Pay per article, per API call, or per second of content
- **High-frequency settlements** — Settle thousands of transactions without fee concerns
- **Small-value transfers** — Send $1 without losing a significant percentage to fees
- **IoT payments** — Machine-to-machine payments become practical

## Fee Comparison

| Network | Typical Fee |
|---------|-------------|
| Tempo   | ~$0.001     |
| Ethereum L1 | $1-50+  |
| Other L2s | $0.01-0.50 |
