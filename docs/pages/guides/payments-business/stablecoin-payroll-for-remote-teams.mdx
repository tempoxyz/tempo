# Stablecoin Payroll for Remote Teams

Remote-first companies face unique payroll challenges. Team members across multiple countries mean dealing with different banking systems, currencies, and processing times. Stablecoin payroll on Tempo unifies your global payments.

## Why Stablecoin Payroll?

### Cost Savings

Traditional international payroll costs add up quickly:

| Method | Cost per Payment |
|--------|-----------------|
| International wire | $25-50 |
| Payroll provider markup | 2-5% of salary |
| Currency conversion | 2-4% FX spread |
| **Tempo stablecoin** | **~$0.001** |

For a 50-person distributed team, monthly payroll costs can drop from thousands of dollars to under $1.

### Speed

- **Traditional payroll**: 3-5 business days for international transfers
- **Tempo**: Instant settlement, any day, any time

### Consistency

Every team member receives payment at the same time, regardless of their location or local banking infrastructure.

## How It Works on Tempo

### Batch Payments

Upload your entire payroll in a single batch. Tempo processes all payments simultaneously, with each transaction costing approximately $0.001.

### Payment Metadata

Attach structured data to each payment:

- Employee ID
- Pay period
- Gross/net amounts
- Tax withholding references
- Department codes

This metadata integrates with your HRIS and accounting systems.

### Stablecoin-Native Gas

Transaction fees are paid in stablecoins—no need to manage ETH or other gas tokens. Your treasury stays simple and predictable.
