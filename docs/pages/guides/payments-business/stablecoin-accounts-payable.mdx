# Stablecoin Accounts Payable

Accounts payable shouldn't be a manual, expensive process. Yet most AP teams still deal with check runs, wire transfer fees, and tedious data entry. Stablecoin payments on Tempo modernize the entire workflow.

## AP Pain Points Addressed

### High Payment Costs

Every wire transfer costs $25-50. Every ACH payment costs $0.25-1.00. For companies processing hundreds of vendor payments monthly, these fees add up to thousands of dollars.

**Tempo solution**: ~$0.001 per payment, regardless of amount.

### Slow Processing

Wire transfers take 1-5 days. ACH takes 2-3 days. International payments can take a week or more.

**Tempo solution**: Instant settlement. Vendors receive funds in seconds.

### Manual Reconciliation

After payments go out, someone has to match bank statements to invoices, update the ledger, and file documentation.

**Tempo solution**: Payment metadata carries invoice numbers, vendor IDs, and GL codes. Data flows automatically to your ERP.

## Tempo AP Features
