# Accept Stablecoin Payments for Business

Stablecoins offer businesses a faster, cheaper alternative to traditional payment rails. With Tempo, you can accept USDC and other stablecoins with transaction fees as low as ~$0.001 and instant settlement—no waiting days for funds to clear.

## Why Accept Stablecoin Payments?

- **Near-zero fees**: Transaction costs of ~$0.001 compared to 2-3% credit card fees
- **Instant settlement**: Funds arrive in seconds, not days
- **Global reach**: Accept payments from anywhere without currency conversion delays
- **No chargebacks**: Transactions are final once confirmed
