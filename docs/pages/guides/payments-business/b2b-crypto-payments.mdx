# B2B Crypto Payments

B2B payments are stuck in the past. Wire transfers, ACH batches, and paper checks dominate despite their costs and delays. Stablecoin payments on Tempo offer a modern alternative purpose-built for business transactions.

## The B2B Payment Problem

| Payment Method | Cost | Settlement Time | Reconciliation |
|---------------|------|-----------------|----------------|
| Wire transfer | $25-50 | 1-5 days | Manual |
| ACH | $0.25-1.00 | 2-3 days | Manual |
| Check | $4-20 | 5-10+ days | Manual |
| Credit card | 2.5-3.5% | 1-2 days | Semi-automated |
| **Tempo** | **~$0.001** | **Instant** | **Automated** |

## Why Stablecoins for B2B?

### Cost Efficiency

A $100,000 B2B payment via wire costs $25-50 in fees. Via Tempo, it costs approximately $0.001. The savings compound across hundreds of monthly payments.

### Speed

Instant settlement means better cash flow management. No more timing payments around bank processing windows or waiting for funds to clear.

### Global Simplicity

Pay international suppliers as easily as domestic ones. No correspondent banks, no SWIFT delays, no currency conversion markups.

### Structured Data

Every payment carries metadata—PO numbers, invoice references, contract IDs—that flows directly into your ERP.

## Tempo's B2B Features

### Batch Payments

Process vendor payments in bulk. Upload a file with payment details or integrate via API. All payments execute in a single transaction.

### Payment Metadata

Attach business context to every transaction:

- Vendor ID
- Invoice number
- PO reference
- GL coding
- Contract reference
- Custom fields

### Stablecoin-Native Gas

Pay transaction fees in USDC. No need to manage ETH or other volatile assets for gas.

### Multi-Signature Approval
