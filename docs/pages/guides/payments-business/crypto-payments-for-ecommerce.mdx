# Crypto Payments for Ecommerce

Credit card fees eat into ecommerce margins. At 2.5-3.5% per transaction plus per-transaction fees, payment processing becomes a significant cost center. Stablecoin payments on Tempo reduce that to approximately $0.001 per transaction.

## The Ecommerce Payment Problem

For a store processing $1M annually:

| Payment Method | Annual Cost |
|---------------|-------------|
| Credit cards (3%) | $30,000 |
| PayPal (2.9% + $0.30) | $29,000+ |
| **Tempo stablecoins** | **~$100** |

Those savings go straight to your bottom line.

## Benefits for Ecommerce

### Near-Zero Fees

~$0.001 per transaction regardless of order value. A $10 order and a $10,000 order cost the same to process.

### No Chargebacks

Stablecoin payments are final. No fraudulent chargebacks, no disputes to manage, no reserve holdbacks.

### Instant Settlement

Funds are available immediately. No waiting for batch processing or payout schedules.

### Global Customers

Accept payments from customers worldwide without dealing with currency conversion or international card fees.

## How It Works

### Checkout Integration

1. Customer selects stablecoin payment at checkout
2. Display payment address and amount (QR code + text)
3. Customer sends payment from their wallet
4. Tempo confirms the transaction instantly
5. Order proceeds to fulfillment

### Order Metadata

Attach order details to each payment:

- Order ID
- Customer ID
- SKUs purchased
- Shipping address hash
- Promo codes applied

This metadata enables automatic order matching and simplifies accounting.

### Payment Confirmation

Tempo's instant finality means you can confirm orders immediately—no waiting for block confirmations or payment verification.

## Integration Options

### API Integration

Integrate Tempo payments directly into your checkout flow:

1. Generate unique payment address per order
2. Monitor for incoming payments via webhook
3. Confirm order when payment arrives
4. Include order ID in payment metadata

### Payment Plugins

Use pre-built integrations for major ecommerce platforms (check [docs.tempo.xyz](https://docs.tempo.xyz) for current availability).

### Hybrid Approach

Offer stablecoins alongside traditional payment methods. Let customers choose based on their preference.

## Operational Considerations

- **Pricing**: Display prices in USD, accept equivalent USDC
- **Refunds**: Process refunds to the original sending address
- **Accounting**: Export transaction data with order metadata for reconciliation
