# Stablecoin Vendor Payments

Paying suppliers shouldn't require expensive wire transfers and days of waiting. Tempo enables instant vendor payments with the metadata your finance team needs.

## Vendor Payment Challenges

Traditional vendor payments create operational friction:

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Wire transfer fees | $25-50 per payment erodes margins |
| Settlement delays | 3-5 days affects supplier relationships |
| International complexity | Correspondent banks add costs and delays |
| Manual reconciliation | AP teams match payments to invoices manually |

## Tempo for Vendor Payments

### Cost Comparison

For a business making 200 vendor payments monthly:

| Method | Monthly Cost | Annual Savings with Tempo |
|--------|--------------|---------------------------|
| Wire transfers | $5,000-10,000 | $59,997+ |
| ACH | $50-200 | $597+ |
| **Tempo** | **~$0.20** | — |

### Key Capabilities

**Instant Settlement**
Vendors receive funds immediately. Improve supplier relationships and negotiate better terms with reliable, fast payments.

**Payment Metadata**
Every payment carries structured data:

- Invoice number
- Purchase order reference
- Vendor ID
- Payment terms applied
- Early payment discount taken

**Multi-Stablecoin Support**
Pay vendors in their preferred stablecoin—USDC, USDT, or other supported assets.

## Implementation

### Accounts Payable Integration

Connect Tempo to your AP workflow:

```typescript
import { Tempo } from '@tempo/sdk';

const tempo = new Tempo({ apiKey: 'your-api-key' });

// Pay approved invoices
const payment = await tempo.payments.create({
  recipient: vendor.walletAddress,
  amount: invoice.amountDue,
  currency: 'USDC',
  metadata: {
    vendorId: vendor.id,
    invoiceNumber: invoice.number,
    poReference: invoice.poNumber,
    paymentTerms: 'Net30',
    dueDate: invoice.dueDate
  }
});
```

### Batch Processing

Pay multiple vendors in a single transaction:

```typescript
const batch = await tempo.batch.create({
  payments: approvedInvoices.map(inv => ({
    recipient: inv.vendor.walletAddress,
    amount: inv.amountDue,
    currency: 'USDC',
    metadata: {
      invoiceNumber: inv.number,
      vendorId: inv.vendorId
    }
  }))
});
```

### Reconciliation

Transaction metadata flows back to your ERP for automatic matching:

1. Payment executes with invoice reference
2. Webhook confirms settlement with full metadata
3. AP system marks invoice as paid
4. Audit trail preserved on-chain

## Vendor Onboarding

### Collecting Wallet Addresses

Add wallet collection to your vendor onboarding:

1. Vendor provides wallet address in portal
2. Verify ownership with test transaction
3. Store address in vendor master record

### Vendor Benefits

Help vendors understand the advantages:

- **Immediate access to funds** — No waiting for bank processing
- **Lower receiving costs** — No incoming wire fees
- **Clear remittance data** — Invoice references included in transaction

## Security and Controls

- **Approval thresholds** — Require multi-sig for payments above set amounts
- **Vendor verification** — Confirm wallet addresses before first payment
- **Immutable records** — Complete audit trail for compliance
