# Crypto Payroll Software

HR and payroll platforms can leverage Tempo to offer stablecoin salary payments, expanding their capabilities for global workforce management.

## Why Add Crypto Payroll?

### Growing Demand

Remote workers, contractors, and international employees increasingly prefer stablecoin payments:

- **Instant access** — No waiting for international wire transfers
- **Lower fees** — Employees keep more of their earnings
- **Currency choice** — Receive USDC/USDT without forex markups

### Platform Differentiation

Payroll platforms with crypto capabilities attract:

- Companies with global remote teams
- Web3 and tech-forward organizations
- Businesses paying international contractors

## Tempo for Payroll Platforms

### Batch Payroll Processing

Execute hundreds of salary payments in a single transaction:

| Feature | Traditional Payroll | Tempo Payroll |
|---------|---------------------|---------------|
| International transfers | $25-50 per payment | ~$0.001 per payment |
| Settlement time | 3-5 business days | Instant |
| Reconciliation | Manual matching | Automated with metadata |

### Payment Metadata

Attach payroll-specific data to every transaction:

- Employee ID
- Pay period dates
- Gross/net amounts
- Tax jurisdiction
- Benefits deductions
- Department/cost center

### Compliance-Ready

- Full audit trail for every payment
- Immutable records for tax reporting
- Structured metadata for regulatory requirements
- Multi-signature approval for large payrolls

## Integration Architecture

### API-First Design

```typescript
import { Tempo } from '@tempo/sdk';

const tempo = new Tempo({ apiKey: 'your-api-key' });

// Process payroll batch
const payroll = await tempo.batch.create({
  payments: employees.map(emp => ({
    recipient: emp.walletAddress,
    amount: emp.netPay,
    currency: 'USDC',
    metadata: {
      employeeId: emp.id,
      payPeriod: '2024-01',
      grossPay: emp.grossPay,
      taxWithheld: emp.taxWithheld
    }
  }))
});
```

### Webhook Notifications

Receive real-time confirmation when payments settle:

```typescript
// Payment confirmed webhook
{
  type: 'batch.completed',
  batchId: 'batch-123',
  payments: [
    { employeeId: 'emp-1', status: 'confirmed', txHash: '0x...' }
  ]
}
```

## Employee Experience

### Wallet Onboarding

Employees can:

1. Connect an existing wallet
2. Create a Tempo smart account with passkey
3. Provide any EVM-compatible address

### Payment Visibility
