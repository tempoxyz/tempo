# Crypto Payment Gateway

Accept stablecoin payments from customers with the speed and reliability merchants expect from traditional payment processors—at a fraction of the cost.

## Why Stablecoin Payments for Merchants?

### Fee Comparison

| Payment Method | Fee | Settlement |
|----------------|-----|------------|
| Credit cards | 2.5-3.5% | 1-2 days |
| PayPal | 2.9% + $0.30 | 1-2 days |
| Wire transfer | $25+ | 1-3 days |
| **Tempo** | **~$0.001** | **Instant** |

For a merchant processing $100,000/month:
- Credit card fees: $2,500-3,500/month
- Tempo fees: ~$1/month

### No Chargebacks

Stablecoin payments are final. No disputes, no reversals, no chargeback fraud.

### Global Customers

Accept payments from customers worldwide without international payment complexity.

## Tempo Gateway Features

### Fast Finality

Transactions confirm in ~0.5 seconds. Customers see immediate confirmation, just like traditional card payments.

### Payment Metadata

Attach order context to every transaction:

- Order ID
- Customer ID
- Cart contents
- Shipping address hash
- Discount codes applied

### Stablecoin-Native Gas

Customers pay transaction fees in stablecoins—no need to hold ETH or other tokens.

## Integration Guide

### Payment Flow

1. Customer selects stablecoin checkout
2. Display payment amount and address
3. Customer sends payment
4. Webhook confirms receipt
5. Fulfill order

### SDK Integration

```typescript
import { Tempo } from '@tempo/sdk';

const tempo = new Tempo({ apiKey: 'your-api-key' });

// Create payment request
const payment = await tempo.payments.create({
  amount: cart.total,
  currency: 'USDC',
  metadata: {
    orderId: order.id,
    customerId: customer.id
  }
});

// Return payment details to frontend
return {
  address: payment.address,
  amount: payment.amount,
  paymentId: payment.id
};
```

### Webhook Handler

```typescript
app.post('/webhooks/tempo', async (req, res) => {
  const event = tempo.webhooks.verify(req.body, req.headers);
  
  if (event.type === 'payment.received') {
    const { orderId } = event.metadata;
    
    // Verify amount matches order
    const order = await getOrder(orderId);
    if (event.amount === order.total) {
      await fulfillOrder(orderId);
    }
  }
  
  res.status(200).send('OK');
});
```

### Checkout Widget

Embed a pre-built checkout component:

```html
<script src="https://js.tempo.xyz/checkout.js"></script>
<div id="tempo-checkout" 
     data-amount="99.00" 
     data-currency="USDC"
     data-order-id="order-123">
</div>
```

## E-Commerce Platform Plugins

## Refund Handling

Process refunds through the same API:

```typescript

  amount: refundAmount,
  reason: 'Customer request'
});
```
