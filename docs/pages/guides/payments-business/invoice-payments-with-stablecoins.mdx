# Invoice Payments with Stablecoins

Waiting 30-60 days for invoice payments is painful enough. Waiting another 3-5 days for the wire to clear makes it worse. Stablecoin invoice payments on Tempo settle instantly with fees under a penny.

## Why Stablecoins for Invoice Payments?

### Faster Access to Funds

- **Wire transfer**: 1-5 business days after initiation
- **ACH**: 2-3 business days
- **Check**: 5-10 days (plus mail time)
- **Tempo stablecoin**: Instant

### Lower Costs

Wire transfers cost $25-50. ACH costs $0.25-1.00. Credit card payments take 2.5-3.5%. Tempo transactions cost approximately $0.001.

### Automatic Reconciliation

Traditional payments arrive as undifferentiated deposits. You have to match them to invoices manually. Tempo payments include metadata—the invoice number is attached to the payment itself.

## How It Works

### 1. Generate a Payment Address

Create a unique payment address for each invoice, or use a single address with invoice-specific metadata requirements.

### 2. Include Payment Instructions

Add stablecoin payment details to your invoice:

```
Pay via stablecoin:
Network: Tempo
Address: 0x...
Amount: 10,000 USDC
Reference: INV-2024-0142
```

### 3. Receive Instant Payment

When your customer pays, funds arrive in seconds. The transaction includes the invoice reference in its metadata.

### 4. Automatic Matching

Your system matches the payment metadata to the open invoice and marks it paid—no manual intervention needed.
