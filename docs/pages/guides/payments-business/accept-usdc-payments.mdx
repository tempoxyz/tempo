# Accept USDC Payments

USDC is the most widely adopted stablecoin for business payments. Tempo provides the infrastructure to accept USDC with minimal fees, instant finality, and enterprise-grade payment tracking.

## Why USDC?

- **Dollar-denominated**: 1 USDC = 1 USD, eliminating volatility concerns
- **Widely held**: Your customers and partners likely already have USDC
- **Regulatory clarity**: Issued by Circle with transparent reserves and audits

## Tempo's USDC Payment Advantages

### Ultra-Low Transaction Costs

Tempo's transaction fees are approximately $0.001—a fraction of a cent per payment. Compare that to:

- Credit cards: 2.5-3.5% + $0.30 per transaction
- Wire transfers: $25-50 per transaction
- ACH: $0.25-1.00 per transaction

### Instant Settlement

USDC payments on Tempo settle in seconds. No T+2 delays, no batch processing windows, no waiting for bank business hours.

### Stablecoin-Native Gas Fees

Unlike other blockchains that require ETH or other volatile tokens for gas, Tempo lets you pay transaction fees in stablecoins. This simplifies treasury management and eliminates gas token volatility.

### Rich Payment Metadata

Attach invoice numbers, PO references, customer IDs, and custom fields to every transaction. This metadata flows directly into your accounting and ERP systems.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Create a Tempo business wallet** to receive USDC payments
2. **Generate unique payment addresses** for each customer or invoice
3. **Set up webhooks** to receive real-time payment notifications
4. **Configure metadata schemas** that match your invoicing workflow
5. **Export transaction data** to your accounting system

## Enterprise Features

- **Batch payments**: Process bulk disbursements in a single transaction
- **Multi-signature wallets**: Require multiple approvals for large transactions
- **API access**: Full programmatic control over payment operations
