# Cross-Border B2B Payments

International B2B payments are expensive and slow. SWIFT transfers, correspondent banks, and currency conversion create friction that stablecoins eliminate entirely.

## The Cross-Border Problem

### Traditional International Payments

| Pain Point | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| SWIFT fees | $30-50 per transfer |
| Correspondent bank fees | Additional $10-30 per intermediary |
| FX conversion markup | 1-4% hidden in exchange rates |
| Settlement time | 2-5 business days |
| Tracking difficulty | Limited visibility into payment status |

### Real Cost Example

Sending $50,000 to an overseas supplier:

| Cost Component | Traditional | Tempo |
|----------------|-------------|-------|
| Transfer fee | $40 | ~$0.001 |
| Correspondent fees | $25 | $0 |
| FX markup (2%) | $1,000 | $0* |
| **Total** | **$1,065** | **~$0.001** |

*Parties transact directly in stablecoins

## Tempo for International Payments

### Borderless by Design

Stablecoin payments on Tempo work the same whether the recipient is across the street or across the world:

- **No correspondent banks** — Direct settlement between parties
- **No SWIFT dependency** — Transactions confirm in seconds
- **No FX complexity** — Both parties transact in USD-pegged stablecoins

### Instant Settlement

Funds arrive immediately regardless of time zones, banking hours, or holidays. Your overseas supplier receives payment at 2 AM on a Sunday as easily as 2 PM on a Tuesday.

### Complete Visibility

Track every payment on-chain:

- Real-time transaction status
- Immutable confirmation records
- Full metadata preserved

## Implementation

### Sending International Payments

```typescript
import { Tempo } from '@tempo/sdk';

const tempo = new Tempo({ apiKey: 'your-api-key' });

const payment = await tempo.payments.create({
  recipient: supplier.walletAddress,
  amount: '50000.00',
  currency: 'USDC',
  metadata: {
    supplierId: supplier.id,
    invoiceNumber: 'INV-2024-0892',
    purchaseOrder: 'PO-45123',
    paymentTerms: 'Net30',
    supplierCountry: 'DE'
  }
});
```

### Batch International Payments

Pay suppliers across multiple countries in one transaction:

```typescript
const batch = await tempo.batch.create({
  payments: [
    { recipient: germanySupplier.wallet, amount: '25000', currency: 'USDC' },
    { recipient: japanSupplier.wallet, amount: '18000', currency: 'USDC' },
    { recipient: brazilSupplier.wallet, amount: '12000', currency: 'USDC' }
  ]
});
```

### Multi-Currency Strategy

While Tempo transactions are in stablecoins, businesses can integrate with local on/off-ramps:

1. Send payment in USDC via Tempo
2. Recipient converts to local currency via their preferred exchange
3. Or recipient holds stablecoins for their own international payments

## Compliance Considerations

### Audit Trail

Every transaction includes:

- Sender and recipient addresses
- Exact timestamp
- Payment metadata (invoice, PO, vendor ID)
- Immutable on-chain record

### Regulatory Readiness

Tempo's structured metadata supports:

- Sanctions screening integration
- Transaction monitoring
- Tax reporting requirements
- Inter-company transfer documentation

## Use Cases

### Manufacturing Supply Chains

Pay component suppliers across Asia with instant confirmation and full traceability.

### Professional Services

Compensate international contractors and consultants without wire transfer delays.

### Software & SaaS

Pay overseas development teams and service providers weekly or bi-weekly without fee overhead.
