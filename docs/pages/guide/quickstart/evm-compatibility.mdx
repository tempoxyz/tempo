# EVM Compatibility

Tempo is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Developers can deploy and interact with smart contracts using the same tools, languages, and frameworks they use on Ethereum, such as Solidity, Foundry, and Hardhat.

While the execution environment mirrors Ethereum's, Tempo introduces some differences optimized for payments, described below.

## Quick Reference

Tempo targets the **Osaka** EVM hard fork with specific differences in execution behavior.

| Area | Ethereum | Tempo |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Native token** | ETH, volatile pricing | USD stablecoins, stable pricing with 6 decimals |
| **Fee market** | EIP-1559 dynamic base fee | Fixed base fee for predictable costs |
| **Token standard** | ERC-20 (flexible decimals) | TIP-20 (standardized 6 decimals, enhanced features) |
| **`PREVRANDAO`** | Randomness from beacon chain | Always `0`; use VRF or oracle for randomness |
| **Payment features** | Contract-level implementation | Protocol-level payment lanes, memos, policies |

## Consensus & Finality

Tempo uses **Simplex BFT consensus** with a permissioned validator set at launch, providing deterministic finality in approximately 06 seconds, unlike Ethereum's finality gadget which takes approximately 12 minutes.

Block times are  targeted at ~0.5 seconds compared to Ethereum's ~12 second slots.

## Fee Market & Native Token

### No Native Token

Tempo does not have a native token like ETH. Instead, the protocol uses USD stablecoins for all fees and balances. This has several important implications:

| Feature | Behavior on Tempo |
|---------|-------------------|
| **`eth_balance` RPC calls** | Return `424242424242...` for compatibility (no meaningful balance) |
| **`BALANCE` and `SELFBALANCE` opcodes** | Do not return native token balance (use TIP-20 `balanceOf` instead) |
| **Transaction fees** | Paid in supported USD-denominated TIP-20 tokens |

### Stablecoin Fees

Users can pay transaction fees in any supported USD-denominated TIP-20 token with sufficient liquidity. The protocol's [Fee AMM](/documentation/protocol/fees/spec-fee-amm) automatically converts your chosen stablecoin to the validator's preferred token at the end of each block.

**Key benefits:**
- Predictable costs in USD terms (fixed base fee, no volatility)
- No need to hold a separate gas token
- Simplified treasury management with single-currency operations

## TIP-20 Token Standard

Tempo uses [TIP-20](/documentation/protocol/tip20/overview) as its primary token standard, extending ERC-20 with payment-specific features:

- **6 decimal precision** - All TIP-20 tokens use 6 decimals for consistency
- **Memo support** - Attach payment references with `transferWithMemo()`
- **Transfer policies** - Built-in compliance via allowlists/blocklists
- **Role-based permissions** - Separate mint, burn, pause, and admin roles
- **Currency awareness** - Tokens declare their currency (e.g., "USD")

TIP-20 tokens are fully backward-compatible with ERC-20 interfaces. Standard ERC-20 functions (`transfer`, `approve`, `transferFrom`) work as expected.
