# Consensus in Tempo

Tempo uses Commonware's Implementation of the [Simplex protocol](https://simplex.blog/) as its consensus protocol, [Threshold Simplex](https://docs.rs/commonware-consensus/latest/commonware_consensus/threshold_simplex/index.html). Simplex is a new family of Byzantine fault tolerant (BFT) protocols that achieves safety and liveness with a remarkably simple structure, while also achieving fast finality in normal network conditions. It is an evolution of earlier generations of consensus such as [PBFT](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/571637.571640) or [HotStuff](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05069).

On Tempo, consensus is currently tuned to `400ms` block times. 

## Fast Finality

The key-tradeoff made in Simplex is to achieve **fast finality** in normal conditions, while still being able to make progress in circumstances a real-world, permissionless network may encounter: Byzantine failures, network delays, and other adversarial conditions. This achieves the best of both worlds: like permissioned networks which offer single slot finality, Simplex is able to offer instant finality (i.e., as soon as the next block) on the happy path. However, unlike permissioned networks, and in the spirit of more robust permissionless networks such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, Simplex is still able to notarize, but not finalize blocks in the face of adversarial conditions, with finalization being delayed until network conditions improve. 

It is important to note that finality in Simplex is **deterministic**. This means that once a block is finalized, it is guaranteed to be a part of the chain going forward and cannot be reverted.
