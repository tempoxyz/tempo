# TIP-20 Standard

TIP-20 is Tempo's native token standard for stablecoins and payment tokens. It extends ERC-20 with payment-focused controls and is the foundation for paying transaction fees and routing liquidity on Tempo. We recommend stablecoin issuers use TIP-20 to issue their tokens, both for standardization and to benefit from Tempo protocol features described below.

## What is TIP-20?

TIP-20 tokens are precompiled contracts that provide a standardized, efficient implementation for stablecoins on Tempo. They extend ERC-20 with features essential for real-world payments:

- **Payment-native design**: Fixed 6 decimal precision for consistent pricing, optional 32-byte memos on transfers for payment references, and guards that prevent sending tokens to other TIP-20 contracts.
- **Deterministic addresses**: Deployed through the [TIP-20 Factory](/documentation/protocol/tip20/spec#tip20factory) to vanity addresses with the 12-byte `0x20C0000000000000000000000000` prefix, making tokens easy to recognize and index.
- **Backward compatible**: Standard ERC-20 calls (`transfer`, `approve`, `transferFrom`) work as expected while adding Tempo-specific capabilities described below.

## Key Benefits

### Payments Lane 

Tempo has dedicated payment lanes: reserved blockspace for payment TIP-20 transactions that other applications cannot consume. Even if there are extremely popular applications on the chain competing for blockspace, payroll runs or customer disbursements execute predictably. Learn more about the [payments lane](/documentation/protocol/blockspace/payment-lane-specification).

### Currency Declaration

A TIP-20 token can declare a currency identifier (e.g., `"USD"`, `"EUR"`) that identifies the real-world asset backing the token. This enables proper routing and pricing in Tempo's [stablecoin exchange](/documentation/protocol/exchange). USD-denominated TIP-20 tokens can be used to pay transaction fees. 

### Pay Fees in Any Stablecoin

Any USD-denominated TIP-20 token can be used to pay transaction fees on Tempo. The [Fee AMM](/documentation/protocol/fees/spec-fee-amm) automatically converts your token to the validator's preferred fee token, eliminating the need for users to hold a separate gas token. This feature works natively: no additional infrastructure or integration required.



### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

TIP-20 includes a built-in [RBAC system](/documentation/protocol/tip403/spec#tip-20-token-roles) that separates administrative responsibilities:

- **ISSUER_ROLE**: Grants permission to mint and burn tokens, enabling controlled token issuance
- **PAUSE_ROLE** / **UNPAUSE_ROLE**: Allows pausing and unpausing token transfers for emergency controls
- **BURN_BLOCKED_ROLE**: Permits burning tokens from blocked addresses (e.g., for compliance actions)

Roles can be granted, revoked, and delegated without custom contract changes. This enables issuers to separate operational roles (e.g., who can mint) from administrative roles (e.g., who can pause). Learn more in the [TIP-20 specification](/documentation/protocol/tip20/spec#roles).

### TIP-403 Transfer Policies

TIP-20 tokens integrate with the [TIP-403 Policy Registry](/documentation/protocol/tip403/overview) to enforce compliance policies. Each token can reference a policy that controls who can send and receive tokens:

- **Whitelist policies**: Only addresses in the whitelist can transfer tokens
- **Blacklist policies**: Addresses in the blacklist are blocked from transferring tokens

Policies can be shared across multiple tokens, enabling consistent compliance enforcement across your token ecosystem. See the [TIP-403 specification](/documentation/protocol/tip403/spec) for details.


### Operational Controls

- **Supply caps**: Set maximum token supply to control issuance
- **Pause/unpause**: Emergency controls to halt transfers when needed
- **Transfer memos**: Attach 32-byte memos to transfers for payment references, invoice IDs, or transaction notes

### Reward Distribution

TIP-20 supports an opt-in [reward distribution system](/documentation/protocol/tip20-rewards/overview) that allows issuers to distribute rewards to token holders. Rewards can be claimed by holders or automatically forwarded to designated recipient addresses.
