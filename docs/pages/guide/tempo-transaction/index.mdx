* [Fee sponsorship](#fee-sponsorship): Sponsor the gas for a transaction, enabling feeless transaction UX for your users.
* [Batching](#batch-calls): Batch multiple transactions together, enabling higher throughput and simpler wallet management by skipping multiple confirmation screens, and saving on cost.
* [Concurrent transactions](#concurrent-transactions): Enable higher throughput and simpler wallet management using parallelizable nonces.
* [Scheduled transactions](#scheduled-transactions): Schedule transactions, enabling you to specify a time window in which the transaction can be executed.
