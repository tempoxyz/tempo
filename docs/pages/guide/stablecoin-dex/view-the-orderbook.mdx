# View the Orderbook

Query and inspect the orderbook to see available liquidity, price levels, and individual orders on Tempo's Stablecoin DEX.

## Recommended Approach

We recommend using indexed data to query the orderbook for better performance and ease of use. While you can query logs and transactions directly from an RPC node, indexed data providers offer structured SQL interfaces that make complex queries simpler and more efficient.

In this guide, we use [Index Supply](https://www.indexsupply.net) as our indexing provider, but you're free to choose your own indexing solution or query the chain directly based on your needs.

## Recipes

### Get the current spread

Query the best bid and ask prices to calculate the current spread for a token pair.

Find the highest bid prices (buyers) for AlphaUSD. This query filters out fully filled and cancelled orders, groups by price level (tick), and shows the top 5 bid prices with their total liquidity.

<IndexSupplyQuery
  title={'Best Bid Prices for AlphaUSD'}
  query={`SELECT
    tick as price,
    SUM(amount) as total_liquidity
  FROM orderplaced
  WHERE token = '0x20c0000000000000000000000000000000000001'
    AND "isBid" = true
    AND NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM orderfilled
      WHERE orderfilled."orderId" = orderplaced."orderId"
        AND orderfilled."partialFill" = false
    )
    AND NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM ordercancelled
      WHERE ordercancelled."orderId" = orderplaced."orderId"
    )
  GROUP BY price
  ORDER BY price DESC
  LIMIT 5`}
  signatures={["OrderPlaced", "OrderFilled", "OrderCancelled"]}
/>

Find the lowest ask prices (sellers) for AlphaUSD. The spread is the difference between the highest bid and lowest ask price.

<IndexSupplyQuery
  title={'Best Ask Prices for AlphaUSD'}
  query={`SELECT
    tick as price,
    SUM(amount) as total_liquidity
  FROM orderplaced
  WHERE token = '0x20c0000000000000000000000000000000000001'
    AND "isBid" = false
    AND NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM orderfilled
      WHERE orderfilled."orderId" = orderplaced."orderId"
        AND orderfilled."partialFill" = false
    )
    AND NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM ordercancelled
      WHERE ordercancelled."orderId" = orderplaced."orderId"
    )
  GROUP BY price
  ORDER BY price
  LIMIT 5`}
  signatures={["OrderPlaced", "OrderFilled", "OrderCancelled"]}
/>

### Inspect order depth

View aggregated liquidity at each price level to understand the orderbook structure.

This query shows all active orders for BetaUSD, including both regular and flip orders (identified by the `isFlipOrder` field).

<IndexSupplyQuery
  title={'BetaUSD Order Depth by Price Level'}
  query={`SELECT
    tick as price,
    "isBid" as is_bid,
    COUNT("orderId") as num_orders,
    SUM(amount) as total_amount
  FROM orderplaced
  WHERE token = '0x20c0000000000000000000000000000000000002'
    AND NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM orderfilled
      WHERE orderfilled."orderId" = orderplaced."orderId"
        AND orderfilled."partialFill" = false
    )
    AND NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM ordercancelled
      WHERE ordercancelled."orderId" = orderplaced."orderId"
    )
  GROUP BY price, is_bid
  ORDER BY is_bid DESC, price
  LIMIT 50`}
  signatures={["OrderPlaced", "OrderFilled", "OrderCancelled"]}
/>

### Inspect an individual order

#### Order details 

Get detailed information about a specific order including its placement details, fill history, and cancellation status.

This query inspects the details of the most recent order for AlphaUSD. It shows when the order was created, at what price (tick), the order size, and who placed it.

<IndexSupplyQuery
  title={'Order Placement Details'}
  query={`SELECT
    "orderId",
    tick,
    "isBid",
    amount,
    maker,
    token,
    "isFlipOrder",
    "flipTick",
    block_num,
    tx_hash
  FROM orderplaced
  WHERE token = '0x20c0000000000000000000000000000000000001'
  ORDER BY block_num DESC
  LIMIT 1`}
  signatures={["OrderPlaced"]}
/>

#### Order fill status

Check if an order has been partially or fully filled. This query shows up to 5 fill events for order number `2`, including the amount filled in each transaction and whether it was a partial fill.

<IndexSupplyQuery
  title={'Order Fill History'}
  query={`SELECT
    "orderId",
    "amountFilled",
    "partialFill",
    block_num,
    tx_hash
  FROM orderfilled
  WHERE "orderId" = 2
  ORDER BY block_num DESC
  LIMIT 5`}
  signatures={["OrderFilled"]}
/>

#### Cancelled orders

Check if an order has been cancelled. This query returns an order for AlphaUSD that was explicitly cancelled by the maker before being fully filled.

<IndexSupplyQuery
  title={'Order Cancellation Status'}
  query={`SELECT
    oc."orderId",
    oc.block_num,
    oc.tx_hash
  FROM ordercancelled oc
  INNER JOIN orderplaced op ON oc."orderId" = op."orderId"
  WHERE op.token = '0x20c0000000000000000000000000000000000001'
  ORDER BY op.block_num DESC
  LIMIT 1`}
  signatures={["OrderCancelled", "OrderPlaced"]}
/>

### Get recent trade prices

View the last prices a token traded at to understand recent market activity.

This query joins order fill events with their corresponding placement details to show the price tick and amount for recent trades.

<IndexSupplyQuery
  title={'Recent Trade Prices for AlphaUSD'}
  query={`SELECT
    ofl.block_num,
    ofl."orderId",
    o.tick as price,
    ofl."amountFilled",
    o."isBid"
  FROM orderfilled ofl
  INNER JOIN orderplaced o
    ON ofl."orderId" = o."orderId"
  WHERE o.token = '0x20c0000000000000000000000000000000000001'
  ORDER BY ofl.block_num DESC
  LIMIT 10`}
  signatures={["OrderFilled", "OrderPlaced"]}
/>
