As of today, Tempo is still in its early phases of development; the first testnet release intended for developers and infra partners is available as of December 9th.

You can get started today by integrating with the Tempo testnet, building on Tempo, running a Tempo node, reading the Tempo protocol specs or by building with Tempo SDKs.
