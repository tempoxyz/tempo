# Batch Transactions

One of the most powerful features of the [Tempo Transaction](/protocol/transactions/spec-tempo-transaction) type is batching multiple operations into a single transaction. This allows you to execute several actions atomically (i.e., they all succeed or all fail together). This helps reduce gas costs, prevents partial failures, and creates better user experiences by combining multiple steps into one transaction.

<Callout type="info">
  Batch transactions are a feature of Tempo's [TempoTransaction type](/protocol/transactions/spec-tempo-transaction). See the TempoTransaction spec for complete details on batching and other features.
</Callout>

## Example: Sending a Batch of Transactions

:::code-group
```ts [batchTransactions.ts]
const { address, hash, id } = await client.sendTransaction({ // [!code focus]
  calls: [{ // [!code focus]
    to: tokenAddress, // [!code focus]
    data: transferCalldata // Transfer tokens // [!code focus]
  }, // [!code focus]
  { // [!code focus]
    to: anotherTokenAddress,  // [!code focus]
    data: approveCalldata // Approve spending // [!code focus]
  }, // [!code focus]
  { // [!code focus]
    to: dexAddress, // [!code focus]
    data: swapCalldata // Execute swap // [!code focus]
  }], // [!code focus]
}) // [!code focus]
```

```ts [viem.config.ts]
// [!include ~/snippets/setup.ts:setup] 
```

## How It Works

Unlike traditional EVM transactions which only support a single call per transaction, the [Tempo Transaction](/protocol/transactions/spec-tempo-transaction) type natively supports a `calls` vector—enabling multiple operations in a single atomic transaction.

### Native Protocol Support

Batching is built directly into the transaction type at the protocol level. This means:

- **Atomic execution**: All calls succeed or all calls revert together—no partial failures
- **Single signature**: Sign once for the entire batch, reducing UX friction
- **Lower gas costs**: Avoid the overhead of multiple transaction submissions
- **No smart contract required**: Works with any EOA, no need to deploy a separate batching contract

### Transaction Structure

The `TempoTransaction` includes a `calls` field that accepts a list of operations:

```rust
pub struct TempoTransaction {
    // ... other fields
    calls: Vec<Call>,  // Batch of calls to execute atomically
    // ...
}

pub struct Call {
    to: TxKind,      // Target address or Create for contract deployment
    value: U256,     // ETH value to send
    input: Bytes,    // Calldata for the call
}
```
