</Callout>

Tempo is a blockchain designed specifically for stablecoin payments. Its architecture focuses on high throughput, low cost, and features that financial institutions, payment service providers, and fintech platforms expect from modern payment infrastructure.

Modern payment applications often operate at a massive scale, processing thousands of transactions that need to settle quickly and at predictable cost. This requires a payment infrastructure that stays reliable even during periods of heavy activity:

- Tempo guarantees high payment throughput by using dedicated “payment lanes” that other applications cannot consume. This ensures that payroll runs, merchant settlements, and disbursements execute reliably even during peak activity.
- Fees on Tempo are low and can be paid directly in the stablecoin of a user’s choice. There’s no need to hold a volatile token like Ether or SOL, which keeps costs predictable and allows transfers to settle for a fraction of a cent.

Enterprise payment systems depend on features that traditional blockchains rarely provide: structured data, batch operations, and the ability to orchestrate many transactions in a single workflow. Tempo is designed with these operational realities in mind:

- Tempo natively supports batch transactions, enabling thousands of payouts to run in one atomic operation, rather than processing and tracking success or failure individually.
- Each transfer can include a short memo, similar to reference fields in traditional payment rails, so finance and operations teams can match payments to internal records without custom tooling or third-party reconciliation systems.

Tempo includes many other features that improve the developer experience and natively provide functionality that are hard to achieve on other blockchains. Examples include the ability to schedule transactions (for subscriptions and recurring payments) and the ability for an app to natively pay fees for its users.

Finally, Tempo enables stablecoin issuers to manage regulatory requirements in a simple and consistent way with built-in capabilities to whitelist or blacklist addresses. Issuers can define a single compliance policy and apply it across all issued tokens. When the policy changes, every token automatically adopts the new requirements.

Upcoming features include native FX and built-in privacy tools, enabling institutions to support multi-currency flows and protect sensitive payment data. Learn more about Tempo’s payment-focused design: Explore Tempo.
