## Learn about Tempo

Tempo is a general-purpose blockchain optimized for payments. Tempo is architected to be a low-cost, high-throughput blockchain with user and developer features that we believe should be core to a modern payment system.

Tempo was designed in close collaboration with an exceptional group of design partners, including Anthropic, Coupang, Deutsche Bank, DoorDash, Lead Bank, Mercury, Nubank, OpenAI, Revolut, Shopify, Standard Chartered, and Visa, who are helping to validate the system against real payment workloads.

New to stablecoins? This section will help you understand what they are, the key use cases they unlock, and how Tempo is built specifically for stablecoin payments.
