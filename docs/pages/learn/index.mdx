# Learn [Notes on stablecoin use cases and Tempo's architecture]

Tempo is a general-purpose blockchain optimized for payments. Tempo is designed to be a low-cost, high-throughput blockchain with user and developer features that we believe should be core to a modern payment system.

Tempo was designed in close collaboration with an exceptional group of [design partners](https://tempo.xyz/ecosystem) who are helping to validate the system against real payment workloads. Here, we have written about what stablecoins are and how Tempo is designed from the ground up for the use cases they enable.
