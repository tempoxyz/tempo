# Stablecoin DEX [Tempo's enshrined exchange for stablecoin trading]

Tempo includes a native decentralized exchange optimized for stablecoins and tokenized deposits. This means users can pay fees in any USD stablecoin, and validators can receive fees in any USD stablecoin, with the protocol automatically converting between them using onchain liquidity. It also consolidates onchain liquidity into a single system that simplifies routing and makes it easy for users to trade between stablecoins, or send cross-stablecoin payments.

## Optimal Pricing and Unified Liquidity

Traditional blockchains fragment stablecoin liquidity across dozens of different DEXs and AMMs. Each protocol maintains isolated liquidity pools, forcing complex routing and inconsistent execution quality. For payment applications where stablecoin interoperability is essential infrastructure, this fragmentation introduces unnecessary complexity.

Tempo's exchange is a singleton precompiled contract deployed at the protocol level. By enshrining the DEX, all stablecoin trading flows through a single venue with unified liquidity. This creates deeper orderbooks, tighter spreads, and more predictable execution for all users.

The exchange operates as a price-time priority orderbook with discrete price ticks, optimized for stable pairs where prices cluster tightly around parity. Unlike AMMs that require constant product formulas and suffer from impermanent loss, the orderbook model lets liquidity providers place limit orders at specific price levels and earn the spread when orders fill.

## Simplified Routing with pathUSD

Each TIP-20 token must specify a single quote token for trading on the exchange. This design forces liquidity into a tree structure where there is exactly one path between any two stablecoins, eliminating routing complexity.

Tempo provides pathUSD, a neutral USD stablecoin, as the natural hub for this tree. Stablecoin issuers can choose pathUSD as their quote token, creating direct trading pairs against a common asset. This mirrors how major fiat currencies often trade through USD as an intermediary, a proven model for efficient price discovery.

For developers, cross-stablecoin swaps become simple and deterministic. The protocol automatically routes through quote token relationships to find the unique path and executes the swap in a single transaction. No need to search for optimal routes or compare prices across multiple venues.

## MEV Resistance

Tempo's orderbook uses delayed placement to prevent MEV extraction. When a user places a limit order during a block, it is queued as "pending" and not visible on the active orderbook until the block ends. At the end of each block, a system transaction inserts all pending orders into their price ticks in creation order.

This prevents backrunning of new limit orders and eliminates just-in-time (JIT) liquidity attacks where MEV bots place and cancel orders around user swaps within the same block. Market orders (swaps) execute immediately against the current active book for instant execution, but new limit orders only appear at block boundaries, forcing market makers to commit liquidity in advance.

Within each price tick, orders match in strict FIFO order based on placement time, ensuring price-time priority, a foundational principle of fair orderbook design.
