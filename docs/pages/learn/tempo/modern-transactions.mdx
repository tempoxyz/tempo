# Tempo Transactions [Modern, optimized, and highly scalable blockchain transactions]

Tempo has built-in support for gas sponsorship, batch transactions, scheduled payments, and modern authentication through passkeys. These features are often grouped together as "smart accounts" or "account abstraction."

On other chains, even when available, these are generally add-on functionalities that require third-party providers to unlock. By natively enabling these features at the protocol level, developers on Tempo can deploy payment logic without managing additional middleware or custom contracts, and can build to enshrined standards.

## Batched Payments

Payment processors and platforms often need to send thousands of payments at once (e.g., payroll runs, merchant settlements, customer refunds). Tempo supports batch transactions where multiple operations execute atomically in a single transaction.

This unlocks high-volume use cases: orchestrators can submit thousands of payouts as a single operation, rather than submitting them one-by-one and tracking individual success or failure. If any operation in the batch fails, the entire batch reverts, ensuring atomic execution across all payments. This is critical for payment operators who need guaranteed settlement guarantees for their workflows.

## Fee Sponsorship

Applications often want to pay transaction fees on behalf of their users. For instance, to simplify onboarding, to improve the user experience, or to remove friction from their payment flows. 

Tempo's protocol-level fee sponsorship allows an account to sign a transaction while a separate sponsor (typically the application) pays the gas fee. This means end users can interact with your application without holding any tokens for fees, dramatically lowering the barrier to entry.

## Scheduled Payments

The Tempo transaction type includes scheduling as a protocol feature. Users can specify a time window for transaction execution, and validators will include the transaction when it becomes valid. 

This enables "set and forget" payment operations directly at the protocol level, enabling recurring payments like subscriptions or scheduled disbursements. No need for external automation services or off-chain infrastructure to manage recurring transactions.

## Modern Authentication

Tempo supports passkey authentication through WebAuthn/P256 signature validation, built directly into the protocol. Users can authenticate with the same biometrics (fingerprint, Face ID) they already use for other apps.

Their keys are stored in their device's secure enclave, and passkeys sync across devices via services they already use such as iCloud Keychain or Google Password Manager. This way, users don't need to secure a 12 or 24-word seed phrase for traditional wallets. For payment applications, this means onboarding flows can be as simple as existing consumer apps, without sacrificing security.

Tempo uses an [EIP-2718](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718) transaction type with native support for these features.
