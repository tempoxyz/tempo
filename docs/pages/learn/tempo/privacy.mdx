# Privacy

Tempo is also developing opt-in privacy features designed to coexist with issuer compliance requirements. This functionality will enable private balances and transfers while maintaining the auditability and reporting capabilities that regulated issuers need.

## Private Token Standard for Stablecoin Issuers

Traditional blockchains make all transaction data publicly visible, which creates challenges for businesses and consumers who need confidentiality. At the same time, regulated stablecoin issuers must maintain compliance and auditability.

We're currently working on multiple designs which provide:
- **Private balances**: Account balances that are hidden from public view while remaining auditable by authorized parties
- **Confidential transfers**: Transaction amounts and participants that can be shielded from the public ledger
- **Selective disclosure**: Issuers and regulators that can maintain the visibility they need for compliance without exposing sensitive business data publicly

## Use Cases for Privacy

When available, private tokens will enable:

**Sensitive business transactions**: Companies will be able to conduct payroll, vendor payments, and treasury operations without revealing confidential financial information to competitors or the public.

**Confidential consumer balances**: Users will be able to hold and transact with stablecoins without publicly broadcasting their account balances or spending patterns.

**Privacy-preserving payment flows**: Platforms will be able to process payments while protecting user privacy and maintaining confidentiality in sensitive transactions.

All of this is achieved while preserving the compliance features that make stablecoins viable in regulated markets. Issuers will be able to maintain the ability to monitor, report, and enforce policies as required by regulation.

## Coming Soon

The native private token standard is currently in development and will be available in a future release. This feature is being designed in close partnership with regulated stablecoin issuers to ensure it meets both privacy needs and regulatory requirements.
