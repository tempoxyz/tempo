# Tempo, The Payments-First Blockchain

Tempo is a general-purpose blockchain optimized for payments. Tempo is architected to be a low-cost, high-throughput blockchain with user and developer features that we believe should be core to a modern payment system. The general-purpose programmability of the blockchain  provides functionality directly in support of our global payments mission: stablecoin interoperability, on-chain FX, compliant privacy, and more. 

## Optimizing Tokens for Payments

Tempo extends the ERC-20 standard used on EVM chains (Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum) with additional features, and enshrines them in protocol as the TIP-20 contract suite. Here is a selection of some of the features this standard unlocks. 

### Predictable Payment Throughput

Tempo has dedicated payment lanes: reserved blockspace for payment transactions (specifically, TIP-20 token transfers) that other applications cannot consume. Even if there are extremely popular applications on the chain competing for blockspace, payroll runs or customer disbursements execute predictably. There is no "noisy neighbor problem” like on traditional blockchains, where blockspace can fill up or cost orders of magnitude more during times of intense activity.

### Low, Predictable Fees, in Stables

Tempo users pay transaction fees directly in stablecoins (USD only at launch). A Fee AMM automatically handles conversion between the user's chosen stablecoin and the validator's preferred stable. Users do not need to hold a volatile cryptocurrency to use the blockchain, and costs are predictable and low: TIP-20 transfers cost less than \$0.001.

### Native Reconciliation 

Tempo's TIP-20 tokens can natively attach a short memo directly to each transfer. This mirrors traditional payment systems, where every transaction carries context (e.g., an invoice number, a customer ID, a cost center, or a simple reference note) for backend systems to automatically match payments to internal records. For larger memos, Tempo supports flexible approaches where only a commitment (like a hash or locator) travels on-chain while the full data (including PII) lives off-chain. This means finance teams can automatically match payments to invoices and payment processors can embed the structured data their systems need without custom solutions or integration with third-party reconciliation infrastructure.

### Built-in Compliance

Stablecoin (and other regulated asset) issuers operate under regulatory requirements. They need to enforce whitelists (only approved addresses can transact) or blacklists (sanctioned addresses cannot transact). Tempo provides a shared compliance infrastructure through the TIP-403 Policy Registry. An issuer can thus create a single policy with their compliance rules, and multiple tokens they issue can adopt that policy. When the compliance manager updates the policy, all tokens using it automatically enforce the new rules, unlike traditional blockchains where an issuer must update each contract one-by-one.

## Tempo Transactions

Tempo natively provides several features often grouped together as “smart accounts”. On other chains, even when available, these are generally add-on functionalities that require third-party providers to unlock. By natively enabling these features, developers on Tempo save on third-party integration overheads, and can build to enshrined standards. 

### Batched Payments
Payment processors and platforms often need to send thousands of payments at once—payroll runs, merchant settlements, customer refunds. Tempo's native account abstraction enables batch transactions where multiple operations execute atomically in a single transaction. This unlocks high-volume use cases: orchestrators can submit thousands of payouts as a single operation, rather than submitting them one-by-one and tracking individual success or failure. 

### Fee Sponsorship 

Applications often want to pay transaction fees on behalf of their users—to simplify onboarding, to improve the user experience, or to remove friction from their payment flows. Tempo's protocol-level fee sponsorship allows an account to sign a transaction while a separate sponsor (typically the application) pays the gas fee. 

### Scheduled Payments
Tempo's account abstraction transaction type includes scheduling as a protocol feature. Users can specify a time window for transaction execution, and validators will include the transaction when it becomes valid. This enables "set and forget" payment operations directly at the protocol level, enabling recurring payments like subscriptions or scheduled disbursements. 

### Modern Authentication
Tempo supports passkey authentication through WebAuthn/P256 signature validation, built directly into the protocol. Users can authenticate with the same biometrics (fingerprint, Face ID) they already use for other apps. Their keys are stored in their device's secure enclave, and passkeys sync across devices via services they already use such as iCloud Keychain or Google Password Manager. This removes significant barriers to mainstream adoption, i.e, the need to secure a 12 or 24-word seed phrase for traditional wallets. 

## High Throughput, Fast Finality

So far we’ve described the payments-first features of Tempo. All of these features are built on a foundation of a highly performant blockchain. We will detail some of the research and engineering behind Tempo in more detail. For now, we focus on the headlines:

### Throughput 

Tempo builds on and extends the most performant EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) execution client, Reth, a client that is also relied upon by several other blockchains including Ethereum, Base and Arc. We have the deep expertise to continue to push the frontier of blockchains: Tempo houses the team that built and maintains Reth, and several other pieces of core blockchain developer software such as Foundry. As such, we are already benchmarking 20k TPS in testnet with a clear line of sight to an order of magnitude higher by mainnet. 

### Finality

Public blockchains that support financial activity need to balance two contradictory demands. On the one hand, the blockchain needs fast finality: e.g., a payment made on the blockchain should be quickly confirmed as final, with no risk of being “re-orged” out as can happen on many blockchains today. On the other hand, the blockchain also needs to degrade gracefully under suboptimal network conditions. Simple solutions to the former problem involve making network assumptions and then simply halting the network when those assumptions aren’t satisfied. Tempo uses Commonware’s implementation of the Simplex Consensus Algorithm. This cutting-edge algorithm optimally trades off these two contradictory desiderata: fast (sub-second)  finality in “normal” network conditions, while still being able to make progress and process transactions when network conditions degrade. 

## Coming Soon

### Onchain FX

An overwhelming majority of cross-border payments facilitated by stablecoins use what is known as the stablecoin sandwich: the on-chain leg is conducted in stablecoins, typically USD-denominated, with on- and off- ramps converting from/ to a local currency. Tempo is developing a novel design to enable users to access FX liquidity directly on chain, including via an exciting set of regulated non-USD stablecoin issuers. When available, Tempo will also allow users to pay for network fees in other currencies. 

### Native private token standard for stablecoin issuers

Tempo is developing opt-in privacy features designed to coexist with issuer compliance requirements. This functionality will enable private balances and transfers while maintaining the auditability and reporting capabilities that regulated issuers need. When available, private tokens will enable sensitive business transactions, confidential consumer balances, and privacy-preserving payment flows—all while preserving the compliance features that make stablecoins viable in regulated markets.
