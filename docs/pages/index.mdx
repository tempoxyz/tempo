## Welcome to Tempo! 

Tempo is a general-purpose blockchain optimized for payments. Tempo is architected to be a low-cost, high-throughput blockchain with user and developer features that we believe should be core to a modern payment system.

Tempo was designed in close collaboration with an [exceptional group of design partners](https://tempo.xyz/ecosystem) who are helping to validate the system against real payment workloads.

In these docs, you'll find guides and resources to help you get started with Tempo.
