# Fees

Tempo is designed with ultra-low, predictable fees that make it cost-effective for global payments: basic transfers cost less than $0.001 USD, and the fees for more complex transactions scale linearly by gas used. Fees are also constant, meaning that the cost of a transaction is the same regardless of the network congestion, with features like our [payment lanes](/documentation/protocol/blockspace/payment-lane-specification) ensuring that payments can get through the network predictably even in times of high activity.

Further, Tempo implements multiple features to make the network more user- and developer-friendly. Firstly, users can [pay fees in any stablecoin](/documentation/protocol/fees/spec-fee) they hold, with an enshrined Fee AMM (Automated Market Maker) handling the conversion between the stablecoin the user wants to use and the stablecoin the validator prefers to be paid in. Unlike other blockchains, there is no native gas token or third-party infrastructure/ additional integration needed to use this feature.  Secondly, the network natively supports gas sponsorship, allowing applications to cover transaction fees for their users, again without the need for additional infrastructure or integration.

These features, combined with the network's high throughput, make Tempo a best-in-class solution for both high-volume institutions/ enterprises/ payment processors and individual users.
