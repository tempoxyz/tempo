# New to Stablecoins?

Welcome! If you are new to stablecoins, this section will help you understand what they are, why they matter, and how Tempo is built specifically for stablecoin payments.

## What are Stablecoins?
Stablecoins are digital representations of money designed to hold a steady value. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ether, stablecoins are pegged to established assets like the U.S. dollar or Euro: they are fully backed by reserves of cash and short-term government securities held with regulated financial institutions. Further, following the introduction of regulatory frameworks like MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) in the EU and Genius in the U.S., stablecoins are now operating under clearer rules around reserve management, auditing, and disclosure. They are, therefore, compliant, reliable instruments for modern payments and financial operations.


## Why Stablecoins Matter
For financial institutions, corporates, and payment providers, fiat-backed stablecoins on blockchains offer a new route for settlement that operates 24/7, across borders, and without the friction of legacy rails. They enable near-instant transfers, reduce intermediaries, and can lower operational costs for both large current use cases like remittances, global payouts and embedded finance, and also for newer use cases uniquely enabled by blockchain rails like micro transactions, agentic commerce and tokenized deposits.

Stablecoins also open the door to programmable money: payments that can execute automatically based on rules or conditions, improving efficiency and transparency. With regulatory approval and institutional-grade custody, fiat-backed stablecoins have become an integral part of the global financial infrastructure.

In short, stablecoins provide the stability and familiarity of fiat currency with the speed and innovation of blockchains, offering institutions and enterprises of all sizes a faster, more efficient way to move value globally.
