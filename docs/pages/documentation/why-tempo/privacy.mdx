# Privacy

Tempo is developing opt-in native privacy features designed to coexist with issuer compliance requirements. This functionality will enable private balances and transfers while maintaining the auditability and reporting capabilities that regulated issuers need. When available, private tokens will enable sensitive business transactions, confidential consumer balances, and privacy-preserving payment flows, all while preserving the compliance features that make stablecoins viable in regulated markets.
