# Neutral Network

In financial infrastructure, neutrality is a foundational principle. Institutions and enterprises need confidence that the platforms they build and operate on will not compete with them or favor specific participants. A neutral network focuses solely on providing reliable infrastructure and ensures that every participant, whether an issuer, payment provider, or financial institution, operates on equal terms. It doesn't compete with the businesses that use it: when a platform also issues assets, operates a payment business, or intermediates customer relationships, it introduces potential conflicts of interest. Institutions and enterprises are less likely to build on such platforms because they risk ceding control over their customer experience, pricing, and data.

Tempo is built in that spirit of neutrality. It provides the infrastructure for stablecoin payments and settlement while remaining independent from the businesses that build on top of it. By being neutral, Tempo allows every institution, from banks to fintechs, to innovate with confidence, knowing the foundation they are building on will remain impartial and dependable.

## Network Governance and Neutrality in Practice

At launch, Tempo will operate with a small, permissioned validator set that allows for secure, reliable operation from day one. This validator set will be composed of independent entities that reflect the network's commitment to neutrality, reflecting diversity among axes such as geography and industry.

Over time, Tempo will transition toward a fully permissionless validator network. This evolution will broaden participation, further decentralize governance, and strengthen neutrality. By moving deliberately from a permissioned to a permissionless model, Tempo ensures both early operational stability and long-term alignment with the open principles that define resilient financial infrastructure in both TradFi (SWIFT, Visa, Mastercard) and DeFi (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana).
