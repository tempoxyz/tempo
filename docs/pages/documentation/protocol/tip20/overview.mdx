# TIP-20 Tokens

## What are TIP-20 Tokens?

TIP-20 is Tempo's token standard for stablecoins and payment tokens. While similar to ERC-20, TIP-20 tokens are purpose-built for real-world payments with features that make them compliant, controllable, and compatible with Tempo's unique fee system.

TIP-20 has built-in [role-based access control](/documentation/protocol/tip403/spec#tip-20-token-roles) system and a [TIP-403 Policy Registry](/documentation/protocol/tip403/overview), which allows issuers to create and manage transfer policies for their tokens.

TIP-20 also supports [reward distribution](/documentation/protocol/tip20-rewards/overview), which allows issuers to distribute rewards to token holders.

## Why TIP-20?

Traditional ERC-20 tokens are great for DeFi, but payments need more:

- **Built-in compliance**: Transfer policies let issuers control who can send and receive tokens, meeting regulatory requirements
- **Controlled issuance**: Role-based permissions separate who can manage tokens from who can issue (mint or burn) them
- **Payment metadata**: Attach memos to transfers for payment references, invoice IDs, or transaction notes
- **Quote tokens**: Every token has a default quote token pair, which can be used to price trades on the exchange
- **Fee flexibility**: Can be used to pay transaction fees on Tempo, swapped automatically through the built-in [Fee AMM](/documentation/protocol/fees/spec-fee-amm)
