# Payment Lanes

Tempo ensures that payment transactions always have available blockspace, even during periods of high network congestion from DeFi activity or complex smart contracts. No action is required by the user to take advantage of this feature. 

This is achieved through **separate gas limits** for payment and non-payment transactions. When blocks are constructed, validators enforce two separate gas constraints:

1. **`gasLimit`** — The total gas available for all transactions (standard Ethereum behavior)
2. **`generalGasLimit`** — The maximum gas that non-payment transactions can consume

Even if non-payment transactions fill up to `generalGasLimit`, payment transactions can still use the remaining capacity up to `gasLimit`.

## How Your Transaction is Classified

Your transaction is automatically classified as a **payment transaction** when:

  1.  the recipient address (`tx.to`) matches the TIP-20 token prefix `0x20c0000000000000000000000000`, or,
  2. for AA transactions, if every item in `tx.calls` is a CALL to an address that matches TIP-20 token prefix `0x20c0000000000000000000000000`.

The classification logic only examines the transaction envelope, and is therefore fast and deterministic.

    Later upgrades may enable other kinds of transactions to be classified as payment transactions as well.

    **Capacity and Priority Fees**: It is theoretically possible for the payment lane to fill up during extreme congestion. In such cases, transactions can set a priority fee to increase their likelihood of inclusion. The payment lane's capacity limit means congestion should be rare in practice.
