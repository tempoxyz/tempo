# TIP-0000: TIP Process

## Abstract

This TIP defines the end-to-end lifecycle for a Tempo Improvement Proposal, from drafting through mainnet rollout. It requires a clear owner, structured review (including security and implications), and an explicit decision at the network upgrade call before a TIP can be approved and scheduled. It also sets rollout expectations for technical communications, tooling implications, and success criteria monitoring.

**External TIP submissions are not accepted at this time.**

## Motivation

The goal of this doc is to create a shared understanding of the TIP process. Every TIP should go through the same stages and meet a consistent bar for security, quality, and user impact. The process emphasizes solving real user problems.

# Specification

## Status Lifecycle

`Draft` → `In Review` / `Rejected`

`In Review` → `Ready for Consideration` / `Rejected`

`Ready for Consideration` → `Approved` / `Rejected`

`Approved` → `Scheduled` → `Testnet` → `Mainnet`

`Approved` means the TIP is accepted and will be scheduled for an upcoming upgrade.

`Scheduled` means the TIP is assigned to a specific upgrade after capacity and upgrade scope are confirmed.

## 1. Propose a TIP

Goal: Turn an idea into a concrete specification.

1. Share your idea and problem statement with the team, get feedback as early as possible.
2. Assign a single TIP owner (driver) responsible for moving the TIP forward.
3. Pick the lowest available TIP number and create branch `TIP/xxxx`.
4. Add `tip-xxxx.md` using the existing [TIP Template](./tip_template.md) and open a draft PR against the Tempo repository.
5. Iterate until the spec is complete; when it is ready for review, open the PR and set status to `In Review`.
6. Share the PR with the relevant stakeholders for review.

## TIP Owner Expectations

Each TIP must have a clear owner who drives it forward, keeps status visible, and stands behind the proposal and its rationale. The owner is responsible for resolving open questions before asking for approval, making sure product and communication implications are covered, and proactively unblocking decisions as the TIP moves through each stage.

## TIP Considerations

When drafting a TIP, clearly explain what the change is, why it is needed now, and which assumptions it depends on. Document the key design decisions, the alternatives you considered and rejected, and your threat model with concrete mitigations. Call out expected impact on existing tooling and users, and define success criteria with the metrics you will track before and after rollout.

## 2. Review the TIP

Goal: Validate the problem and design with stakeholders and ensure the TIP meets our bar for quality, security and  impact.

1. Share the TIP for stakeholder review and keep the PR updated.
2. Provide evidence that the problem is real.
3. Provide evidence that the design is feasible and robust.
4. Complete a security review.
5. Complete an implications review that covers affected tooling, integrations, and partners. The outcome of the review should be shared with the respective stakeholders.
6. Run at least one whiteboard session to align context.
7. Obtain engineering, research, and security approval.
8. After approvals, merge and set status to `Ready for Consideration`.

## 3. Consideration and Decision

Goal: Move a `Ready for Consideration` TIP to a decision.

1. Once the TIP is `Ready for Consideration`, the TIP owner adds it to the next network upgrade call agenda.
2. The agenda entry must include a clear callout: `Decision required: Approve or Reject TIP-xxxx`.
3. The TIP owner prepares a concise summary of review feedback, tradeoffs, and spec changes.
4. The TIP owner explicitly asks for a decision during the call.

## 4. Network Upgrade Call

Purpose: Make decisions on TIPs.

1. Review each agenda TIP in `Ready for Consideration`.
2. The TIP owner presents the full case, including review feedback, tradeoffs, and spec changes.
3. Decide outcome: `Approved` or `Rejected`.
4. For approved TIPs, confirm the target upcoming upgrade when possible.

## 5. Scheduling Criteria

A TIP can move from `Approved` to `Scheduled` only if:

1. Engineering capacity is available.
2. The target upgrade is identified.
3. The rationale for inclusion timing is explicit (`Why include? Why now?`).
4. The TIP spec is complete as the technical source of truth, and written technical communication is prepared for rollout.

## 6. Testnet Release Readiness

Before releasing an upgrade to `Testnet`:

1. Publish written technical communication for the upgrade, including tooling changes and users that might be affected by the change.
2. Ensure dashboards and alerting are in place for success criteria.
